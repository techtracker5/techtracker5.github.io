<p>1.1 petit flour to 14.0 Upside Down Cake, Android a mobile operating system made for smartphones came a long way, in the initial version Android doesn&#8217;t have any codename but later on as the creator of Android &#8220;Andy Rubins love deserts each new version of Android has named with desert names classified as codenames, since the inception starting from alpha 1.0 version Android in the process of updating and upgrading to next level over the years has gone through a lot of developments by fixing loopholes aka bugs and by adapting to latest trends and technologies needed and wanted by userbase around the world accordingly, thanks to that as time goes in just few years Android became powerful and advanced modern operating system used by majority of people worldwide, isn&#8217;t that quite fantastic? but the problem here is if you own an old Android device then due to it&#8217;s outdated hardware and software technologies, latest Android versions may be incompatible and won&#8217;t work well, that can be concerning to certain percentage of people as for whatever reasons many people still use old Android devices, mainy because they can&#8217;t afford new ones, or even if they can afford still wanna use old Android device or it&#8217;s software versions for nostalgia reasons, are you one of them?</p>
<p>If yes then as said earlier old Android devices comes with outdated hardware and software technologies which means they can be incompatible and won&#8217;t be able to install latest versions of Android thus you&#8217;ll get limited options and features that may cause un-fulfilling overall user experience, yet you may accept and ok with it and no matter what you still wanna use old Android devices, isn&#8217;t it? But there are many developers who are not ready for it they won&#8217;t work and support outdated old Android devices, because old Android devices usually lack large userbase and latest technologies, so adding support for them definitely requires extra load on back with lack of enough returns, which is why many developers eventually stop support for old Android devices, while some right from the start solely focus on providing support for latest Android devices and software versions, so at the end if you&#8217;re someone who own old Android device or software versions then now or in future you are the one who going to suffer as the latest softwares from stock OEM or third party developers are what keeps you stay connected and updated, not having them can push you back in this tech world.</p>

<p>Google, as you may know a well known search engine from Alphabet inc. own many revolutionary and amazing digital products as shown above, it&#8217;s not just them there are many more and the list goes on, though out of them almost all digital products have huge userbase and successful yet to reduce back load and due to various different strategies and reasons already discontinued and ended support for some of them permanently and may going to do the same for more in future on all or old Android devices and software versions, while some digital products are only made and exclusive for new ones, so basically at the end when Google being such a large scale company with huge capacity and resources struggle, fail and decide to discontinue and end further support to old Android devices and software versions, how can a small single individual or team of developers were able to maintain and continue product support forever, it&#8217;s not a simple cake walk right? So expecting and demanding support can sometimes bit outrageous for sure yet still a lot of people out of necessity keep on demanding or requesting developers to provide support for old Android devices and software versions, isn&#8217;t that right?</p>
<p>YouTube, as per context let us now focus on it, you may know YouTube is world&#8217;s popular leading social video blogging platform currently owned and developed by Google, it is in existence for more than a decade, back in the beginning days of YouTube, it used to have pretty basic limited options and features but as time goes as per research and development which include demands, requests, needs and requirements of people including that to meet latest standards and adapt to new technologies, Google not just added but also removed many interesting and useful options and features thanks to that we got to see robust feature rich modern YouTube for cross platforms, but the problem here is Google for whatever reasons won&#8217;t let latest Android versions use old YouTube app versions and old Android versions use latest YouTube app versions, while there are certain old YouTube app versions, they won&#8217;t work on old or new Android versions which can be issue as certain percentage of people for whatever reasons mainly to get old layout or options and features like and want to use old YouTube app versions, but as they are now unavailable on latest YouTube app versions, many people who want them usually get disappointed and try to somehow get them, though it is not possible to get them on official YouTube app but there are numerous modified and custom patched YouTube apps by using them we can not just get old layout and features on latest YouTube versions but also use discontinued old or new YouTube app versions on old Android devices.</p>
<p>Even thought, there are number of modified custom patched YouTube apps available for Android devices out of them Vanced YouTube is most popular one but eventually it was discontinued due to law suit from Google but later on inspired by Vanced, number of developers as Vanced is open source using it&#8217;s code with some additional contributions tried to bring back Vanced Project as it is liked and used by a lot of users mainy geeks, in that process we got to eventually see Project ReVanced which is considered as current successor of Vanced YouTube Project, ReVanced just like Vanced, provide many extra features and options that you won&#8217;t get on official YouTube app including that ReVanced also let you use old YouTube apps options and features, layouts etc, thanks to that many people who like and want to utilize them usually shift to ReVanced from the official YouTube app, isn&#8217;t? which is smart choice but the only drawback of original Project ReVanced app is it targets latest Android versions not the old ones, so you won&#8217;t be able to use latest versions of ReVanced on old Android devices and software versions even old versions of ReVanced eventually stop working on old Android versions just like stock official YouTube app, isn&#8217;t that bit disappointing? but wait thanks to some geeky developers who found workarounds to use the old versions of ReVanced on old Android devices and software versions like starting from lollipop 5.0 by using slightly modified custom patched ReVanced app versions made by them, you&#8217;re now able to enjoy YouTube on go, isn&#8217;t that exciting!</p>
<p>The last YouTube version available for Android 6 Marshmallow and Android 7 Nougut, is 17.34.36 but as said earlier Google eventually stop support for them, I expect they already did it, so developer Kitadai31 who at one point back then using old Android device and software versions, want to make YouTube app work on old Android 6.0 and 7.0 versions, in that process he found a workaround by forking RVX aka ReVanced Extended v2.160.1 by Initia00, as it&#8217;s the last compatible patch with YouTube version 17.34.36, and then accordingly he created some ReVanced patches to modify and spoof YouTube at the same time fix some issues, glitches and backport some features like endless buffering, to provide a stable version of ReVanced for Android 6.0 and 7.0 devices, at present his modified RVX versions is working well and was beneficial to many people, but the only drawback here is his version won&#8217;t work on Android 5.0 lollipop, if you want YouTube work on that version then Kitadai31 suggest you to use another fork of ReVanced by developer d4n3436 who spoofed YouTube 16.40.36 thanks to that now you can experience YouTube on much older Android versions, cool right?</p>
<p>You may know Android 5.0 lollipop software version is like 10 years old released back in year 2014, at present even on browser you can&#8217;t use YouTube on Android 5.0 device browser, as Google not just stopped support for app but also for webview as well, considering that getting access to YouTube app now on Android 5.0 devices in the era of Android 14 and 15 is simply marvellous thing, just think about it such a old Android version device still able to play videos on YouTube that to with latest options and features, it&#8217;s for sure a useful jackpot isn&#8217;t it? If you have a old Android device in desk or use it as a backup or secondary device for calls and messages etc, in that as an addition get to access YouTube will be amazing including that let&#8217;s say you have a spare old Android 5.0, 6.0, 7.0 version device and wanna give or gift to someone who just simply want to use calls, messages and YouTube for such person, pre-installing ReVanced YouTube will work fabulously, not just that if you limited yourself not to utilize old Android devices and softwares versions as on that there is support for YouTube but now with the help of patched ReVanced you may be able to continue using old Android device and version as a daily driver regularly.</p>
<p>Revanced Extended by d4n3436 is for YouTube version 16.40.36, by using that as said earlier now you can use YouTube on Android 5.0 lollipop devices, which is based on kitadai31&#8217;s fork of ReVanced Extended for Android 6/7, that&#8217;s for sure is exciting, but wait if you&#8217;re someone who don&#8217;t have any past usage experience with ReVanced, then hold on, if you&#8217;re a newbie to this custom patched YouTube apps then you need to know some things before you get started as mis-handling them can lead to soft or hard bricking device, foremost you can install ReVanced in non root and root mode, while root mode is way stable and you usually don&#8217;t get issues including that it doesn&#8217;t require extra microg apps to login to Google accounts, when it comes to non-root you may find incompatibility issues and it likely requires extra microg app to login into Google accounts, at the same time non root ReVanced mode don&#8217;t usually work on custom Android softwares like MIUI and HiOS etc, while root mode of ReVanced very likely gonna work on them, anyway at the end you have to install non root ReVanced YouTube like any other app but for the root version you have choice to install it as module through Magisk or in the custom recovery, so do you like it? are you ready to use YouTube on Android 5, 6, 7, devices, if yes then let&#8217;s get started.</p>

<p>Overall, ReVanced comes with light and dark mode by default, it has clean and simple interface that ensures user friendly experience, but in any project there is always space for improvement so let&#8217;s wait and see will ReVanced get any major UI changes in future to make it even more better, as of now ReVanced is fantastic.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is very important to mention Kitadai31 and d4n3436 ReVanced Patches are one of the very few free and open source projects which focused on making YouTube work on old Android 5.0 lollipop, 6.0 Marshmallow, 7.0 Nougut versions, Yes, indeed if you are searching for such ReVanced YouTube Project by they have potential to become your new favorite.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Doing things at right time and at right place is what make [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/neo-wellbeing-a-foss-alternative-to-google-digital-wellbeing.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/neo-wellbeing-a-foss-alternative-to-google-digital-wellbeing.webp" alt="neo-wellbeing-a-foss-alternative-to-google-digital-wellbeing" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>Doing things at right time and at right place is what make your life organised right? Many people right from the day on plan when and what things should be done next isn&#8217;t it? so far we know thanks to a lot of scientific studies time is flexible and it moves slow and fast based on it&#8217;s place, like for instance time travels slow in space and on some planets in comparison to the planet earth, including that time also travel slow when you move and go fast at super high speeds, if you&#8217;ve read Albert Einstein time dilation theory then you may probably know it&#8217;s fascinating concept, isn&#8217;t it? Like that there is another popular &amp; interesting theory known as time travelling with time machine that basically state we can go to past or future in time, many people say it&#8217;s baseless and not possible, but there are a lot of people who believe that it&#8217;s possible as there is nothing impossible in this quite magical super natural universe, yet we are not sure but one thing is clear as per logic if we rely upon scientific research then it provides many theories which confirm that we may not be able to travel to past but we can definitely travel to future, for example : if we go for a space ride at light speed for like few years and return back to the earth then you may find you&#8217;re younger than the other people at your age at the same time more than twice or thrice time already got passed on earth like shown in Interstellar movie, in sense we may likely can&#8217;t travel to past and uncertain about future, so we can&#8217;t change things happened in past and we can&#8217;t control things which are going to happen in future, so why to worry about anything? At the end living in present time and scheduling plans for the future is what matters most isn&#8217;t it? and that&#8217;s why time is precious? so wise don&#8217;t waste time.</p>
<p>If you waste your time or not? That&#8217;s up to you, but in one way or another you&#8217;ll be part of someone else time, as time is omni present and it&#8217;s everywhere for everyone isn&#8217;t it? for example: let&#8217;s say you simply stay still like rock and doesn&#8217;t do anything in the time but things around you may not do the same, and they may do whatever they want in time, including that you may somehow directly or indirectly get effected or impacted by it like for instance let&#8217;s say you may want sunny day or you may want some fruit fall down from tree instantly, will it come or fall instantly or at exact time you want? Definitely not isn&#8217;t? They will come or fall when time comes right? So you can&#8217;t do anything except accept the timings of them, basically things may not always go as you plan instead they may go by the things around you, for example to understand better let&#8217;s say you planted a seed and want it to become tree or you call some bird out of nowhere and want it to come instantly, will it happen? Nope it will very likely not, as being a human being you lack the command to control the other beings actions and time, though you may with intervention somehow can make the things go as you plan upto certain extent but not entirely &amp; not all the time, because things will only happen if they themselves want and at their own desired time, so due to that in one way or another you will be involved in someone else time and you have to go as per their time and scheduled plans thus they will do the same for you, in simple if you respect time then mutually it will do same to you, and acknowledge the fact change is part of time, for instance let&#8217;s say air may be slow at certain time in someplace but the very next minute it may change, if you understand what&#8217;s time and how it will work, then you&#8217;ll able to better manage and adapt to time pretty well.</p>
<p>Time is eternal and ever lasting one, at present scientific studies didn&#8217;t found a place where there is no time, basically if you feel something then there is time without that there will be nothing but will there be nothing? even if it is that nothing will be something, time is super natural which on it&#8217;s own didn&#8217;t provide any kind of formulas to calculate it except the fact you can feel it&#8217;s presence, thanks to that over the years many smart human beings have developed numerous formulas to calculate time, due to that eventually now as per our convenience we are able to calculate time in seconds, minutes, hours, days, years, decades, centuries, millennium and so on, including that they were further divided like 60 milliseconds = 1 second and 60 seconds = 1 minute, 60 minutes = 1 hour, 24 hours = 1 day, 7 days = week, 30 days = 1 month, 12 months / 365 days = 1 year, 10 years = 1 decade, 10 decades = 1 century, and 10 centuries = 1 millenium etc so that will be able to calculate and feel time better and accurately, majority of people around the world from past number of centuries calculating and feeling time as per them except animals and other beings, they have their own formulas and senses to calculate time, at the end when majority of people calculate and feel time that way then you being a individual who depended on others may have to go in that track as well, else you will be left behind which is not good if you want to adapt and live in harmony with them universally.</p>
<p>In sense, people basically designed their own mind framework and formulas to calculate time in order to check, arrange, understand, do whatever things they want and go on in time conveniently, back in ancient times people as per their own understanding and comfort created many different frameworks to calculate time including that though primitive they even created numerous different types of clocks and calenders to understand and track past gone and upcoming time mostly calculated based on earth rotation around planet sun and moon, as it&#8217;s more ideal than anything else because human beings relied on them for light / dark immensely, in detailed half rotation of earth which is in direction with the sun provide sunlight on earth and other half of earth which is in direction with the moon provide darkness on earth, while light and dark since ages are essential for survival and livelihood of human beings, eventually human beings named earth rotation phases timelines accordingly, however due to lack of proper knowledge back then calculation of time and earth rotation time phases used to be little inaccurate, but later on as time goes we got to see high tech tools, scientific studies, advanced mathematics and technologies due to that we are able to calculate time and earth rotation phase timelines accurately and efficiently.</p>
<p>There used to be number of calenders over the years created by ancients with their own different types of frameworks and formulas to calculate time, which are mostly based on earth rotation around sun or moon known as solar and lunar cycles, out of them most calenders were little bit in-accurate somewhere but as time goes many intellectuals developed and found many different better ways to calculate time thanks to them eventually we got to see way better and accurate calenders like Gregorian which in modern times we along with clocks utilising worldwide to track the past gone and upcoming timelines, in the solar cycle based Gregorian calendar we find naming for the earth rotation phases timelines categorized into days, months, years including that Gregorian calender also calculated to have 365 days per year which was widely accepted, confirmed and approved to be legit and accurate by the latest scientific research studies, which is why now a days we use it extensively isn&#8217;t it? though Gregorian calendar can be used globally but it&#8217;s not everything because it only tracks the days, months and years not the actual live time, we use the Gregorian calendar in conjunction with 24 hours per day yet still it doesn&#8217;t track the live time right? as said earlier time changes based on speed and place, so calender is not the right tool to calculate live time, instead we have to rely on different types of clocks.</p>
<p>On planet earth people reside in different parts around the world right? While earth rotates eastwards as it rotates different parts of earth are exposed to sun or moon at various intervals basically that&#8217;s what we call earth rotation phases timelines, because of that earth and people get to experience many different light and dark conditions, people to use in daily life have named all earth rotation phases timelines like morning, afternoon, evening, night etc, including that many intellectuals over the years created many timezones based on earth rotation to precise calculate time in certain part of earth including that based on the time zones we got clocks thanks to them, now people around world were able to collaborate and function together very well, at first people used to rely on rock or sun and moon shadow clocks but as time goes eventually we got mechanical analog clocks and now in modern times we have digital clocks which are way advanced and better than existing ones, now a days most people using analog clocks in par with the digital clocks balancedly as analog clocks are still in wide usage and have potential to be continued in future as well, anyway in analog or digital clocks we commonly use 12 hour format ante meridiem and post meridiem for general purposes in home, office, private and public outlets etc including that we also use 24 hour format mostly in military, aviation, trains, science, medicine, emergency services etc, which time format are you using right now?</p>
<p>You use any format time, but thing is very clear considering various factors in review, digital clocks are usually more flexible and feature packed than regular analog clocks thanks to embedded digital technologies, in the beginning stage digital clocks used to be basic but as time goes due to a lot of updates and upgrades they&#8217;ve became pro, in sense at present we have such digital clocks in them you will be able to calculate time extensively like ability to check all the timezones, stop watch, set timer, alarm etc including that as digital clocks are digital basically software they can be included in any digital electronic devices, though we have regular wall and wrist digital clocks and on many electronic devices will find digital clocks like on television, keypad mobiles, refrigerators, radio etc yet thing is some of them are basic and mainly big in size and not quite portable as well, which is why majority of people around the world now instead utilize modern and portable smartphones and smartwatches in them, people can not just check time but also do a lot of things on the go using apps, but the problem here is sometimes a lot of people due to whatever reasons lost track on how much time they&#8217;ve been spend on smartphones which is not good as unable to track and mis-managing the time spend on smartphones and smartwatches can cause trouble to you, even harmful and overtime it can be quite addictive that can lead to psychological or any other health issues, that&#8217;s something you don&#8217;t want to let happen right? If so then you may glad to know now a days most smartphones &amp; smartwatches operating systems inbuild integrated with tools to track the time that you&#8217;ve spend on smartphones everyday.</p>
<p>Google Digital Wellbeing is one such top widely used tool, by using it you&#8217;ll be able to better manage, focus and track the time that you&#8217;ve spend on smartphones and smartwatches created and integrated by search engine giant Google on their own Android powered smartphones and smartwatches though Google is well known conglomerate that created and launched many revolutionary and reliable products trusted by millions yet there are certain percentage of people who don&#8217;t like to use Google Digital Wellbeing mainly because it&#8217;s closed source software which can be concerning as the problem with closed source softwares is their code is usually encrypted and private due to that you won&#8217;t know what&#8217;s hidden in private encrypted code unless you can decode and decrypt it which is difficult and can be done only by skilled developer Including that some developers even encrypt code with virus, malware, malicious trackers, spywares, RAT aka remote adminstration tools etc and hide them well, which are sometimes not even detectable by some antivirus softwares or experts, using such closed source softwares can be risky as they can cause damage to your device privacy and security, so to solve this big issue in recent years we got to see a lot of people and geeks stopped using closed source softwares instead craving for free and open source softwares aka FOSS.</p>
<p>Recently, we got to know about an feature rich FOSS alternative to Google digital Wellbeing named Neo Wellbeing, which is still in early access phase but what matters most is it&#8217;s free and open source, the benefits of using FOSS is their code is usually made public available as repository project on contributive development platforms like GitHub or GitLab etc, as FOSS provide transparency of code due to that anyone online can check and review repository projects to find errors, faults, violations, security, legitimacy, authencity of code thanks to that when using foss projects you&#8217;ll get much better security and privacy thus you&#8217;ll stay in safe zone at the same time foss projects usually also allow anyone to commit and contribute code to fastrack development of project so that you&#8217;ll get faster updates and upgrades including that foss projects also allow anyone to fork code so that people can develop their own custom version of them with their own removed or added external options, features, and optimizations etc, at the end foss projects are way flexible and provide much better experience than the closed source ones for sure, so do you like it? Are you interested in foss projects like Neo Wellbeing? If yes then let&#8217;s explore more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/apatch-a-root-solution-alternative-to-magisk-and-kernelsu.webp" alt="apatch-a-root-solution-alternative-to-magisk-and-kernelsu" width="400" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve checked number of rooting softwares so far, a decade back we used to have plenty of rooting softwares to root Android devices basically smartphones, like Kingo root, Frama root, Super SU etc, as back in time a decade ago it&#8217;s the beginning era of modern smartphones, at that time they used to have new early access hardware and software, which are emerging ones with astounding capabilities at the same time considering available technologies at that time they are powerful, advanced and revolutionary as well, but as they are in early access they used to have a lot of bugs and security is not up to the mark in comparison to today&#8217;s standards, due to that developers were able to simply find and exploit loop holes in hardware and mainly in software to modify parameters of them for various different purposes, but as time goes makers of them tightened and strengthened security of hardware and software of smartphones using a lot of technologies due to that now it became pretty hard and difficult to find loopholes and exploit them even in order to do that in present time requires unlocking of device bootloader compulsorily, in sense it&#8217;s not easy as before, you must need external PC or device and has to be done carefully.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.techtracker.in/2022/04/why-you-should-root-your-android.html" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">+ Why you should root your Android smartphone?</a></p>
<p>Now a days, mobile makers by default powering up their smartphones with modern feature rich operating systems like HiOS, HyperOS, ColorOS, MIUI etc and software applications with such advanced features and options that a decade back we used to only get them when we root device for sure, including that to make things much easier now we also got to find no root methods to customize and modify operating system by getting access through android debug bridge aka adb commands and apps like Shizuku, though no root ways are not as powerful as root but they are pretty much enough for a lot of people to do more than a non root mode device, but thing is if you don&#8217;t have stock feature rich operating system, and don&#8217;t wanna root &amp; engage in non root adb command based methods yet still we can get root level customizations through custom roms, which are developed by third party developers, in order to flash custom roms you need to have compatible device with unlocked bootloader after that with right guidelines you&#8217;ll be able to flash any compatible custom roms through adb or using custom recovery like TWRP, at the end all this procedure seems complicated for newbies but once done quite worthy.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.techtracker.in/2022/03/hios-vs-miui-which-is-best-custom.html" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">+ HiOS vs MIUI, which is best custom Android OS on smartphones?</a></p>
<p>Even though, at present time we have many custom roms and no root methods which provide root level features and options on non rooted smartphones but at the end they may be not enough for some people especially geeks, due to various different reasons mainly because though some stock firmwares, third party custom roms and adb based methods may provide number of amazing features and options but still rooting provide full authority and way better different level experience, like basically with root you will get complete control of your smartphone as you can do almost anything on software and hardware from modifying system files, customizing graphical user interface, over-cloaking or under-cloaking CPU and GPU etc, what not you can unlock, remove any OEM based restrictions and limitations to gain access to everything which is not possible in non root mode, that&#8217;s why rooted smartphone with it&#8217;s plenty of benefits usually always have way better edge over non root ones but it all comes at the cost of some cons like as rooting can do anything in system level, modifying incorrectly can make the device unusable or irreparable including that it also voids statutory device warranty unless you live in EU aka european union.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.techtracker.in/2022/04/why-you-shouldnt-root-your-android.html" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">+ Why you shouldn&#8217;t root your Android smartphone?</a></p>
<p>There are number of rooting softwares based on operating systems available on smartphones, Android and iOS are most popular and widely used top operating systems for smartphones, though we can get system level access on both operating systems but on iOS rooting is known as jailbreak, if you&#8217;re someone who owns iPhone then you may be familiar with jailbreaking iOS, anyhow both operating systems are from different makers and developed using different technologies, while Android is free and open source released and maintained by Google and iOS is a closed source by Apple inc. due to that we can&#8217;t utilize same methods and software applications to get root access on them, but thing if the convenience of rooting smartphone is your top priority then it&#8217;s better go with Android it&#8217;s FOSS, so source code is publicly available online in form of AOSP, that makes things easier to find bugs and rooting Android powered smartphones, but when it comes to iOS powered iPhones as they&#8217;re closed source software and hardware wise, it&#8217;s not just difficult but also hard to jailbreak iOS, yet still thanks to skilled developers out there who somehow were able to find methods to jailbreak every latest version of iOS, at the end based on your needs and factors it&#8217;s up to you to choose Android or iOS.</p>
<p>If you choose to have Android, then you&#8217;re at right place, as said earlier back in time in the beginning era of smartphones and mobile operating systems, rooting Android smartphones used to be pretty simple, at that time there are many capable apps for mobiles and softwares for PCs, they used to root most Android smartphones in one click without unlocking bootloader that to in just few minutes thanks to that a lot of users almost all the time with just mobile app itself were able to easily root Android, though we do have desktop apps as well but they are less likely and rarely used by majority of Android users, whoever don&#8217;t have PC and want more comfort at the same time don&#8217;t want to put extra work in setting up and connecting Android with PC using proper USB cable and drivers, used to always prefer mobile root apps, anyway at the end though one click root apps are convenient but thing is most of them are closed source and the methods they used to root Android versions are not public due to that they are not trustworthy including that rooting softwares get direct system level write access which means any mess up in process or aftermath of rooting may soft or hard brick device which may only get fixed or recovered when you re-flash stock firmware, isn&#8217;t that risky? Anyway as time goes in latest versions of Android OS security level increased immensely, due to that most one click rooting softwares have stopped support at the same time popular rooting software SuperSu got discontinued back in year 2016, so many Android users wanted new way better alternative rooting software, at that time we got systemless Android root software named Magisk.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.techtracker.in/2022/09/what-happened-to-chainfire-supersu.html" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">+ What happened to Chainfire SuperSu?</a></p>
<p>Magisk is revolutionary systemless Android rooting software developed by topjohnwu, thanks to it&#8217;s systemless root method it got huge popularity and most Android users eventually shifted to Magisk and it became best alternative to Chainfire SuperSu, at present time Magisk is still on go choice for majority of Android users, unlike old one click root and SuperSU root based methods they used to enable direct system root access, that as said earlier is risky thing, while Magisk is systemless which means though it does get you root system level write access but it&#8217;s achieved by patching firmware boot image after that Magisk create a overlay under your root partition and link it, due to that whatever root data will be in overlay, because of that when thing mess up and goes wrong, you don&#8217;t have to hard reset device instead you just uninstall Magisk or it&#8217;s modules via recovery or restore your stock firmware boot image, which in most cases will unbrick or solve issues of your Android device, that&#8217;s why Magisk is considered as way better safe rooting software but like most softwares it has downsides as well, the main issue with Magisk is you must unlock device bootloader, and it patches stock firmware boot image including that it will also alter system root partition by storing Magisk data that arises SafetyNet issue, basically it makes your Android device fail in Google&#8217;s basic integrity and CTS aka compatibility test suite profile match thus your Android device will be acknowledged as quite unsecure and untrustworthy due to that you can&#8217;t run some secure apps, which can be fixed using modules like play integrity, playcurl, MagiskHideProps, SafetyNet etc but it&#8217;s temporary fix including that Magisk is also not quite reliable in hiding root from device and apps, though there are few ways like MagiskHide, DenyList, Shamiko etc to fix, they do work but not accurately which is why many Android users wanted better and reliable alternative to Magisk, as there is demand to supply lately we got to see kernel based Android root softwares.</p>

<p>Kernel, is most important thing on smartphones, it&#8217;s basically in simple words connect and work as bridge between your device hardware and software, without kernel you can&#8217;t make things works on device, in sense kernel is quite sensitive thing that has to be handled with care else it may hard brick your device, which is why many developers suggest not to touch and play around with kernel and even if you do make sure to always backup device kernel, so that there will be chances of recovering bricked device, though messing up with kernel is like playing with fire, yet still for the improvement of device, many geeky developers explore kernel, tweaks kernel and also patch and make custom kernels, mainly to upgrade or update operating system, improve performance, battery life and better compatibility with hardware and software etc, isn&#8217;t that amazing? in recent years as said earlier kernel based Android solutions came up in this tech world, out of them the one I can recall is KernelSU, which basically patches Kernel to achieve root access on Android device because of that root won&#8217;t be detected by device or apps and it will also pass basic integrity and CTS profile match. due to that you&#8217;ll get better privacy, security and anonymity, which is why KernelSU considered as way better and more reliable rooting software than Magisk including that KernelSU also provide modules support thanks to that day by day KernelSU userbase growing immensely and it&#8217;s widely considered as the best alternative to Magisk, but thing is though KernelSU is something that we can definitely rely upon yet still some people for whatever reasons want and search for way better alternative to KernelSU.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.techtracker.in/2023/05/kernelsu-kernel-based-android-root.html" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">+ KernelSU &#8211; A kernel based Android root alternative to Magisk.</a></p>
<p>Recently, after the success of KernelSU, many developers making their own kernel based root softwares for Android devices, out of them the one that picking up and became one of the best alternative to KernelSU is an free and open source software named APatch that uses Kernel Patch as core and KernelSU for magisk module like support and app UI aka user interface, at present APatch only support ARM64 with Android kernel Version 3.18 &#8211; 6.1 devices, but we may in future also get support for ARM7 and X86 devices as well with other Kernel versions, including that team also planned support for Samsung devices, at the end APatch is basically a modified version of KernelSU so if you&#8217;re someone who right on don&#8217;t want to use KernelSU can go for APatch, including that there is APatch Lite developed by APatch developer Ponces, APatch Lite basically has Hardcoded superkey for simplicity with simplified UI dashboard and No KPM management, which didn&#8217;t exist in orginal version of APatch, but thing is as superkey is hardcoded in APatch Lite it is not secure thus you have to use it quite carefully, so do you like it?

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/paynav-now-get-digital-gold-every-time-you-shop-offline-or-online.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/paynav-now-get-digital-gold-every-time-you-shop-offline-or-online.webp" alt="paynav-now-get-digital-gold-every-time-you-shop-offline-or-online" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>Value, each and everything that you see and touch around you has unique value isn&#8217;t it? usually value of things change from each and every individual being right? as giving value or valuation to something is basically pyschological thing that&#8217;s quite unique and different to each and every one so due to pyschology some people tend to give more value to something which is not given value by some other people and vice versa, as it&#8217;s based on their requirements and many other factors mainly how they see that something because not everyone is capable enough to understand as well as estimate value of thing, in sense some people find value in everything and some people don&#8217;t find value in everything, at the end in mind of people value of plethora of things available in this massive universe will keep on changing from time to time as it&#8217;s pyschological, which is why something that&#8217;s quite highly valuable in the past may not have value in future and vice versa.</p>
<p>Generally, if we look at things with broad mind then will get to know, everything in this universe has immeasurable value but due to various different reasons and purposes, living beings in this universe. according to time, as said earlier based on their psychology and usage needs given certain estimated value to things they are aware off, and then created and found many ways to express value of things like through actions, drawings, words, sounds shapes, numbers like for example: let&#8217;s say there is a object, if we show that object to someone and ask value of that object then that person may express value of it either through actions like bodily movements &amp; signs, or drawings like arts, paintings etc, or sounds like spoken and hearable ones, or words and numbers either vocal or written ones, or shapes like rectangle, square and traingle, etc, isn&#8217;t it? Thought actions, drawings, words, sounds, shapes are widely used by majority of people most of the time to express value but numbers ranks on top which are quite heavily used to express value of things worldwide.</p>
<p>Even though, as said earlier everything on this universe has immeasurable value, but to be more specific in this context due to unique psychology, value on something usually changes from each and every individual being due to that a individual may give high value to something and another individual may give less value, in sense each and every individual being due to their unique psychological mind give their own certain value to each and every existing specific thing like for example : let&#8217;s say there is a pen which is being selled for 10$, but one buyer may find it&#8217;s value more than 10$, and another buyer may find it&#8217;s value lower like 5$, it is also possible there may be many buyers who find the value way lower like 3$ even if they have more necessity than the fellow buyers, in sense though requirement play pivotal role in increasing value of thing but not all the time, there are numerous other psychologically driven factors which play quite important role in increasing as well as decreasing value of things primarily like level of requirement, interest, attraction etc that&#8217;s why most of the time will very likely find atleast slightest point difference of valuation between set of individuals and groups etc as valuation is psychological it is volatile in nature as valuation is unique to each being it can change anytime.</p>
<p>But, there are certain things available in this universe which large percentage of people on planet earth unanimously give more value to them like gold, silver and diamonds etc mainly known to be found on planet earth, they are rare objects and hard to find which is why since ancient times they&#8217;ve been given immense value by a lot of people, in sense many human beings thought have unique psychology yet have one thing in common which is basically to give more value to rare and hard to find and get things, because of that metals like gold, silver and rocks like diamonds, platinum etc got quite huge prominence and at one point back in time gold, silver and diamonds even replaced barter system, in sense people used to exchange things for things but eventually people started exchanging gold, silver and diamonds to buy things from each other due to that eventually they&#8217;ve become mode of payment and considered as money, but the problem here is as time goes gold, silver, diamonds become more rare due to that value of them increased exponentially and they&#8217;ve became quite expensive so many people started to think buying gold, silver and diamonds as good investment and started to believe having them is like status symbol, due to huge demand worldwide they can be selled anytime thanks to that they even worked as security in time of financial set backs globally, isn&#8217;t that pretty amazing?</p>
<p>However, though for long time gold, silver, and diamonds as they were being highly valued by large percentage around the world due to that they&#8217;ve worked pretty well as mode of payment, but there are some usage hardships and drawbacks with them like for instance, foremost thought gold, silver, diamonds can be shaped to any size and shape but thing is gold, silver, diamonds are not readily available as they are rare and it&#8217;s hard to find and get them mainly because they are available under earth, so in order to get huge quantities of them large workforce have to mine for long time with quite big machines and technologies which all are expensive stuff and things to do, so even if some mining companies somehow were able to extract huge quantities of them still at the end there will be difficulties in maintaining and using them in the real world, like primarily making and storing them is super hard &amp; expensive including that in reality especially in this era utilzing them is inconvenient as they are heavy to carry and exchanging in big numbers can be problematic which is why to suit to the current modern era financial dynamics, governments introduced paper money also known as fiat &amp; cash currency which is easy to make, store and light weight as well thanks to that eventually paper aka fiat currency replaced and also working as an alternative to gold, silver, diamonds as money and mode of payment from past few centuries worldwide effectively.</p>
<p>In sense, paper money aka fiat currency is readily available as paper is made from wood, it is recyclable as well thanks to that governments will have to spend very less money in comparison to mining to make paper money including that as paper is basically plain sheet on that governments can simply print any value they want due to that a simple paper that commercially has little value will get immense value in real world just because it has big value printed on it and that was authorized by government entity, paper money was big deal back in early era when it was for the first time got introduced to public by many modern governments, but now all this is may be pretty normal thing yet the fact is emergence of paper money is fascinating and quite beneficial to society in number of ways isn&#8217;t? for instance as paper weight is small, lite weight, slick people were able to easily store in small space, carry and exchange them on their own and were also able to deposit &amp; withdraw huge amounts from banks on the go conveniently around the world, anyhow though paper money does have many benefits at the same time it has drawbacks as well like to name few as paper money is wood based physical material it is destroyable, not traceable and can be duplicated by anyone with right tools &amp; skills, such practices will increase money laundering, corruption, and black money which has negative impacts on society, that&#8217;s why good governments and people since long time wanted an better alternative to paper currency to utilize as money, thanks to the efforts of a lot of intellectuals eventually after few centuries, in early 20th century we got to see digital money which governments were able to track and keep things in check for a safe, regulated and legal money usage in this world including that people were able to way simply and quickly utilize the digital money with the help of digital as well as electronic technologies comfortably.</p>
<p>Digital revolution paved way for digital money, in emergence and opting to many revolutionary digital technologies mainly internet, operating systems and application softwares etc with right electronic technologies like mobiles, computers, desktops in place to use them, the dream of digital money came true in 90s era and it&#8217;s usage grown exponentially in 20th &amp; 21st century, though technically digital money as it&#8217;s basically digital code that you can see on digital screen is different from paper money but certain digital money&#8217;s provided by number of platforms can be somehow converted to paper money, for example : banks will only provide digital money when in backend you have paper money got deposited in your bank account by you or bank itself, which means digital money basically work as face and have connection with actual paper money, but there can be also many digital money&#8217;s which have no relation to fiat money and will work autonomously, anyway thanks to many governments who in co-ordination with central bank have recognized and legalized digital money including that regulated and controlled public and private banks in adapting to trend and concept of digital money eco- system at the same time governments and banks in order to level up usage of digital money together developed and offered necessary platforms and services for people to utilize digital money in real world like ATMs and banking apps etc integrated with bunch of digital technologies to make domestic &amp; international money transfers around the clock quickly and efficiently but thing is at the end digital money has pros and cons just like paper money, when it comes to pros as digital money is digital as long as you have compatible electronic device and internet to view it you can get, check, &amp; use digital anywhere and anytime, including that as digital money is basically a digital number it has digital size which is so tiny that even trillions of digital numbers can be saved in few kb &#8211; kilobyte storage because of that any value digital money can be simply sent and received instantly using internet or any wired or wireless technologies due to that without moving anywhere you&#8217;ll be able to send and receive digital money globally including that if the digital currency is provided by banks then transactions by users are recorded and if required can be in supervision of the state governments or law enforcement agencies to keep things in check, reduce and stop illegal and fraud money transfers and practices so that only white money gets into picture and people will use money safely and legally but the pros of digital money comes with it&#8217;s cons for instance as digital money is basically technology, even with strict security measures still there is always chance of loop holes which can be exploited by hackers to get access to anyone digital money and simply theft it or do anything without trace anonymously including that digital money provided by banks are centralized and guarded by in build private technologies, so there is no transparency due to that owners of digital money won&#8217;t know what and how banks are doing under the hood with their private personal data and digital money, which is concerning for many people, that&#8217;s why a lot of them wanted an better alternative to digital money provided by banks with transparency, better security, privacy with complete ownership of digital money and no reliance on any centralized institutions like banks, as there is such requirement to supply back in year 2009 we got to see new digital money known as crypto.</p>
<p>Crypto currency is basically digital money aka currency, but it is not provided by governments or banks instead they are usually created and provided by non-government entities, crypto is basically decentralized currency which doesn&#8217;t rely on centralized institutions like banks instead it has it&#8217;s own decentralized infrastructure to provide users of crypto with top notch transparency by providing full information basically being free and open source about all of it&#8217;s underlying technologies, and transactions of users will be recorded in blockchain explorers that ensures whatever transactions are happening in crypto ecosystem are real and validated by crypto technologies, including that most crypto currencies also provide best possible security to it&#8217;s users and whatever transactions happening in it&#8217;s ecosystem, by providing encrypted and secured crypto wallets for users to store their crypto currency which are locked using backup phrase until or unless a person has that no one will able to open crypto wallet including that most crypto currencies networks usually utilze proof of stake system in that set of miners will solve block of codes using their own computer power in order to verify each transaction for that they&#8217;ll receive crypto rewards and also this procedure verify each transaction thus it ensures each and every transaction is tamper proof that provides security including that crypto currency also provide immense privacy to users like by not making it essential for user to provide personal details to register and use crypto wallets including that all the transactions recorded in blockchain will not have personal details of sender or reciever that ensures anonymity of users, It is all possible because decentralization is core concept of crypto currency and it&#8217;s quite rooted in all it&#8217;s open and underlying technologies isn&#8217;t that fantastic which is why since the inception of crypto currency a lot of people mainly geeks who want an alternative to fiat currency &amp; regular digital money started exploring and investing in revolutionary crypto currency networks.</p>
<p>The start of crypto currencies began when psuedonymous satoshi nakamoto created world&#8217;s first revolutionary decentralized crypto currency named bitcoin back in year 2009 which is created to replace mediators like banks and provide way better robust digital currency that provides transparency, security, privacy, anonymity for people, back in the beginning bitcoin doesn&#8217;t have much value as creator wanted organic growth of product thanks to that gradually day by day bitcoin attracted investors around the world to level that it&#8217;s value skyrocketed making a lot of early bitcoin investors networth millions and billions, after that eventually the huge hype and potential surrounded around the bitcoin driven it to get huge fanbase and it&#8217;s underlying ecosytem and technologies inspired many developers to build their own amazing crypto currency networks like solana, ethereum, matrix etc, alternative to Bitcoin, but thing is at the end crypto currencies are considered as asset just like gold, silver, diamonds etc as they have their own value which just like any other asset their value get increased when demand is high and get decreased when demand is low, though fiat currency can also be considered as an asset due to it&#8217;s rise and fall of value overtime but not the reliable one as fiat currency is limited to specific state or country which value is based on issuing country government and their economy conditions with face value in global stage basically fiat currency not have universal value, while cryptos does, and they being decentralized can bypass censorship so they can&#8217;t be restricted or limited by anyone but there&#8217;s a catch all crypto currencies are not legally approved, audited neither recognized by government so there is always risk when dealing with crypto currencies and relying on them is like walking on unstable bridge, yet still demand for crypto currencies is growing up mainly due to it&#8217;s huge returns and associated path breaking technologies but there can be big losess as well which is why having or utilizing bitcoin with high expectations is not ideal instead utilize cryptos carefully to be in safe zone.</p>
<p>Robert Kiyosaki, well known co-writer of popular financial related selling book &#8220;Rich Dad, Poor Dad, who also authored many other financial related books, emphasized many times if you want your money back then investing in assets like gold, silver, land, cattle as best for long term over in stock market, as they are more reliable due to their universal stable value, while stock market can crash anytime which is evident in history, though big crashes in stock market is quite normal in every few decades but still what if bad aliens landed on earth and wipe out all stuff which are core and essential to run stock market? If not aliens something else who knows? So there is always high risk in stock market and it&#8217;s not the safe option for thoso who can&#8217;t take risk and adventure into stock market, for people with low financial risk appetite gold, silver, diamonds, land, home, cattle etc are best on go choices because they may have slow growth in value but it&#8217;s steady and they&#8217;ll have pretty high value in future mainly gold, silver, diamonds due to their rarity, while home, land and cattle are required and became necesisty for most people so value of them very likely may not get nullified around the world.</p>
<p>In india, since ancient times mainly gold next comes silver, diamonds have pretty high significance which are not just seen as status symbol but also they are quite deeply rooted in land culture, traditions, religions, and among many communities, due to that buying or wearing mainly gold on certain occassations or days are quite special and considered by many as lucky and auspicious including that many indian families in india have custom and tradition to pass gold and other valuable items to next generations which is why demand for gold and then silver, diamonds etc since long time persists in india, but thing is like many countries utilizing gold as mode of payment and money has been taken over by paper money in modern era, there may be certain percentage of people who still using gold, silver and diamonds as mode of payment but most people in india and around the world has shifted to fiat paper money to do almost all transactions, so considering decades long usage and the advantages of paper money, gold atleast for few decades upcoming may not be able to replace paper money, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>Anyhow, though as said above gold, silver, and diamonds etc may not very soon replace fiat paper money but they are always in usage as alternative to fiat paper money, thanks to their universal high value most people if given option to choose between them and fiat money, majority of people like to have gold, silver, diamonds over fiat paper money, but unfortunately people in a lot of platforms primarily have to must use paper fiat money to buy things or receive and get paid for anything, due to that at the end considering the reliance on paper fiat money in current financial world, most people have to externally buy and receive or get paid gold, silver, diamonds from certain dedicated platforms or by using fiat paper money and then store them somewhere to use them later for various purposes, in sense a lot of people viewing gold, silver, diamonds as backup money including that when gold, silver, diamonds value raise up, in need many people selling gold, silver, diamonds in exchange of paper fiat money, which all seems fine isn&#8217;t it? But thing is not all people were able to afford gold, silver and diamonds as they are now quite expensive which is why a lot of people somehow and find various ways, work to get gold, silver, diamonds into their personal treasure.</p>
<p>There are numerous ways to get gold, silver, diamonds primarily through mining, if lucky enough then it&#8217;s easy but normally extracting gold, silver, diamonds from underground is expensive so most people instead buy gold, silver and diamonds from sellers in exchange of their fiat money, but thing is as said earlier there are a lot of people who can&#8217;t and unable to afford gold, silver, diamonds due to lack of sufficient paper fiat money including that there are certain percentage of people who even being able to afford gold, silver, diamonds still don&#8217;t want to directly buy them instead want to somehow get them through other ways like as rewards or freebies, for instance through exchange of valuable items like utensils and properties for gold, silver, diamonds, or win them through certain competitions, or even get them as bonus like by extracting from certain items like electronics, including that that are certain sellers who offer some amount of gold, silver, diamonds and other valuable things as bonus for purchasing or utilizing their products or services etc, isn&#8217;t that pretty amazing!</p>
<p>Now a days, in view of digital technologies, a lot of physical things have been digitalized for the convenience, easyness, and comfort of public, in progress of that we got to see digital gold, which from past decade got huge popularity around the world as it&#8217;s way easy to buy and transfer in few clicks, technically digital gold is actually same as physical gold but the only difference is digital gold usually have to be purchased from online outlets through web platforms like shopping, stock and banking apps etc, when a person purchase digital gold from registered and licensed platform then they according to the quantity and other factors convert digital gold into physical gold and store them in secured lockers including that the person who owns digital gold can exchange digital gold for physical gold as well, thanks to the benefits of digital gold many people purchasing digital gold with fiat, digital, crypto currency but thing is there are certain percentage of people who don&#8217;t want to directly purchase digital gold instead somehow get and earn digital gold for free as rewards, bonus for doing activities like completing of tasks, playing games, shopping online etc, as there are such people for them in recent years we got to see number of digital platforms who seems to provide digital gold rewards.</p>
<p>Recently, we got to know about an feature rich interesting digital platform named PayNav, a P2P investment platform in partnership with RBI-approved NBFC and processed by P2P asset partner Lendbox providing upto 30% cashback basically 24K digital gold as reward for shopping online in india at over 500+ online popular stores like Amazon, Bigbasket, Zivame, Flipkart, Swiggy, Zomato, Makemytrip, Uber, Shoppers Stop, Westside, Croma, Tanishq etc including that through PayNav in-store you can enjoy special deals and cashback at over top 1000 food outlets and stores to choose like including KFC, Barbeque Nation, Mainland China, Third wave Coffee, Starbucks, Spar, More, Bookmyshow, Shoppers Stop, Chumbak, Max Raymond, Bata, Pantaloons, Vmart, Tbz, PVR Cinemas, Apollo Pharmacy, Puma, Bata, Sketchers, Body Shop, Health &amp; Glow, Himalaya, Croma, Natures Basket, Spencer&#8217;s, Decathlon and more!, at the end you can withdraw your digital gold rewards as cash or physical gold coins, it&#8217;s not just that PayNav also offers upto 9.5% interest on savings account with debit card and portfolio insurance on the go, ain&#8217;t all this seems worthy? there may be many more things coming up from PayNav in future, so do you like it? are you interested in PayNav? if yes let&#8217;s explore more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/studiovity-ultimate-tool-to-organize-your-film-making-workflow-on-the-go.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/studiovity-ultimate-tool-to-organize-your-film-making-workflow-on-the-go.webp" width="400" alt="studiovity-ultimate-tool-to-organize-your-film-making-workflow-on-the-go"></a></p>
<p>From silent black and white films to 4k+ resolution ultra high defination 10bit films, as time goes thanks to evolution of many technologies over the years due to them film production came a long way, in sense we got to see timely emergence of many revolutionary technologies over the years in each and every era, in the process of adapting and utilizing them the way film makers make and show films to viewers changed accordingly for the benefit of them and audience including that many technologies over the years directly or indirectly increased market value of film industry around the world which now in 21st century digital era worth billions of dollars, as there is huge market value and reach for films globally, many companies and individuals for passion or to somehow get benefitted from films investing a lot of money in producing and releasing of films, mainly to generate profitable revenue, due to that over the years we got to see many big budget films out of them some are hit and some are flops at the box office.</p>
<p>In sense, since long time many companies and individuals willing to spend a lot of money in producing films as there is huge scope and potential to them, when films are in public domain they can impact people around the world in various different ways based on genre and content of film like inspire, motivate, educate, spread awareness, horrify, laugh, influence and many more, while makers can show, promote, advertise, whatever they want in films to get desired return outcomes like response, engagement, fame and generate revenue from viewers as additional bonus etc, so basically at the end both makers as well as viewers have mutual benefit in context of films, which is why global film industry continuously rising up and evolving to new levels constantly for the benefit of all, in the process over past few decades we got to see different modes and names in publication of films based on their medium and run time like movies, cinemas, web series, tv shows, short films, and serials, etc isn&#8217;t that interesting?</p>
<p>Films are basically medium to share visual content in that sound content can be added to present way better and detailed information and experience to watching audience, people through films can share content filled with information related to anything, thought there are many people who get into film industry primarily see it as worthy tool to only make big sum money, but at the same time thanks to impact of films from past few centuries around the world due to that in the back end there are a lot of people who primarly get into film industry not for money but only for their passion towards films in order to mainly show off their talent and skills, knowledge, craftsmanship etc in  form of actors, actresses, directors, producers, technicians etc, at the end undoubtedly because of combination of both money and passion minded people, film industry growing well else it wouldn&#8217;t as lacking any of them will result in poor performance of film industry globally.</p>
<p>If there is passion then the maker can create good quality content films but without money it&#8217;s hard for maker to create rich content films as making certain films need big budget to get desired outcome, as rich film making is expensive, makers rely on big investors basically producers to full-fill their budget requirements in order to make films, for suppose if producer is not money minded then producer may not invest and manage making of film well in right direction to get desired output and drive film to generate profits which can result in financial losses that can lead to bankruptcy and eventually may trouble producer career in film industry, at the same time in parallel if the maker like director don&#8217;t have passion in making of film then even if there is big budget for film still output quality of film will be poor which is not beneficial for producer, maker, audience, so it eventually may trouble, maker career in film industry as well which is why money minded and passionate people in balance proportions for sure necessary in any film industry.</p>
<p>Even though, if there is only money mindset in producer and only passion in maker then as said earlier it works but in reverse it may not work well as for producer having only passion is not enough at the same time for maker having only money mindset is not enough in the execution and making of film, due to their different working structure and end result goals, but having both money mindset and passion in producer and maker in context of films then it is considered as fabulous combo as such people may work more unitedly in making of film and drive it in right direction and get best possible quality output of film, which is why makers wish to have money mindset passionate producers and vice versa, thought money is not always driving force for certain percentage of passionate producers and makers, but money as reward to efforts can give required boost and work as an 360% shield on the maker in society which give self reliability, confidence and better life etc due to that they will be able to perform better in making of films and maker may continuously try to improvize the craft to get more and more rewards in form of money or anything else worthy.</p>
<p>However, it doesn&#8217;t always mean if there is money minded passionate producer and maker then whatever film they made will be successful, as only making of film will be in control of them, and once film got released and it&#8217;s available in public domain then the success of film is determined by how many people watched, liked and rated film and how well film in short and long run performed at the box office basically collections, which is why since the early days of films, majority of producers and makers used to spend a lot of money and time in advertising and promoting their films so that their films will reach to more people worldwide, thought if film really have potential content then it will get organic reach but still if possible doing advertisements and promotions for film is beneficial for sure, because sometimes for whatever reasons even good films don&#8217;t get reach organically, that&#8217;s why as maker despite your film turned out good or bad in your view still spreading the word of your film as much as possible at your best in your decided budget and capacity is quite important and necessary because now a days a lot of films release ever day around the world and there is huge competition in film industry, due to that if your film have low budget and it&#8217;s not good enough then it&#8217;s difficult &#038; hard for film to get enough limelight, so it&#8217;s better to spread the word of your film since the start of film making to attract audience so that after release of film you may get to see audience already waiting to see your film quite eagerly.</p>
<p>Camera, do you know what exactly is it? You may probably do isn&#8217;t? If you&#8217;re watching films that&#8217;s because we have cameras as films are basically recorded physical, electronic, digital foot print of real life thing captured using camera, In the early era camera used to be basic and theatres used to be only medium for films to show them to audience but eventually as time goes due to the evolution of technologies and demand for much better cameras and mediums for films, in that process in each decade we got to see new type of cameras and mediums to show various types of films like 2D, 3D, 4D, etc, and by 20th century we got to see super cool powerful and advanced professional modern DSLR cinema cameras to capture films vividly and amazing mediums to show films to audience like mult-plexes, television, home theatres, computers and mainly smartphones thanks to them a lot of people were able to capture, show and see films conveniently at their comfort zone easily and efficiently on the go.</p>
<p>The latest camera and medium technologies to capture and show films have increased reach of films to audience quite effectively, thanks to efforts of inventors and films makers in utilizing them for the mutual benefit of them and people around the world, at present film industry is big deal, many people have dreams and work hard to get into and make career in film industry, back in early 19th century due to basic cameras and only medium is theatres to show films, it used to be hard and difficult to get into film industry but now in this modern digital era we have super high quality cameras and awesome electronic as well as digital technologies at palm of your hands in form of smartphones which are available at cheapest price in market, due to that even the person who have poor financial condition if have potential and smart skills may somehow get into film industry and may make sensational films for sure.</p>
<p>If you are an aspiring film maker and already in the making of films, then you may probably know film making is big process and from start to finish has to be done carefully like from writing of script, direction, cinematography, photography, dance, music, costumes, editing and pre production etc, there is a lot of stuff behind the making of films, so they have to be managed well right? Back in early era of films people used to remember or write whatever things necessary for films on paper notes but now in this digital age we have fantastic softwares by using them you can manage making stuff of films easily isn&#8217;t that amazing? There are many film making stuff management softwares out of them we recently got to know about an all in one solution comprehensive film pre-production management or you may call companion app named Studiovity for smartphones, so do you like it? are you interested?

					<description><![CDATA[Anything, around you which you see, touch and use doesn&#8217;t exist without [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/owlfiles-powerful-file-manager-for-cloud-servers-storages-etc.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/owlfiles-powerful-file-manager-for-cloud-servers-storages-etc.webp" alt="owlfiles-powerful-file-manager-for-cloud-servers-storages-etc" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>Anything, around you which you see, touch and use doesn&#8217;t exist without space right? we scientifically don&#8217;t yet know how much space is available in this universe, but we humans were able to use whatever space available to us according to our needs in whichever way possible accordingly, to store or move things in space area right? living beings mainly humans since they came into existence utilized whatever space available to their reach in whichever way possible extensively by making boundaries in order to do constructive operations, for example : people not just occupied space on earth by themselves, but also created new things out of existing ones to occupy more space at the same time created their own many different type and layout structure on existing space for various purposes like for instance in form of homes, stores, underground basements, tunnels and pipes etc, isn&#8217;t that right?</p>
<p>In sense, space is basically empty area that can be occupiable by things, which distance, height, width is measurable thanks to our formulas and calculations, so based on that we can build layout on top of space with things to add boundaries and then occupy and use accordingly, for example to understand better let&#8217;s say there is 10 miles of empty space, if it can be seen and accessible then you may able to measure it by yourself or with external technologies and based on it&#8217;s coverage area you can divide by adding boundaries on top of it inside already existing space boundaries to see or do desired things, in simple if you draw or build square, traingle or rectangle etc shaped lines or structure basically build layout on top of space then whatever space radius inside of lines or structure basically layout can be occupied till it&#8217;s limits set by boundaries so that as per your requirements you may be able to better manage existing space on go.</p>
<p>If we say space then it must have boundaries as without it we can&#8217;t call it as space, basically space is determined by it&#8217;s boundaries so if the space you have has square shaped layout boundaries then whatever things you want to put or move inside of space area has to be placed and settled as per it&#8217;s boundaries, for example : let&#8217;s say there is traingle shaped layout boundaries on top of space due to that inside space will have traingle shaped radius, in simple if there is traingle shaped layout on top of space and if you stuff some material on space radius inside of traingle shaped layout boundaries to it&#8217;s max limit then whatever materials that you stuffed inside of space radius will be limited to it&#8217;s boundaries due to that whatever stuffed materials inside space radius will simply form shape of traingle, but that will only happen when traingle shaped layout boundaries are stiff and have capability to hold whatever stuffed materials inside space radius well.</p>
<p>But, thing is when whatever stuffed material inside the space radius of traingle or any other shaped layout boundaries is more then limits of space radius then it can break layout boundaries, there after stuffed material may go out of it&#8217;s space radius and material may loose it&#8217;s shape, which is why when building layout on top of space, it&#8217;s important to take care of layout design, material and technologies as per your requirements well to get the desired outcome else it may go wrong, like for example : if we take any shape rubber balloon and fill it with air, water or any other material then the rubber balloon can expand 5 times bigger then it&#8217;s original size as rubber material is elastic in nature isn&#8217;t it? but if we take a paper balloon and fill with same materials in same quantity of rubber balloon, will it be able to hold and expand size? Definitely not right? As paper material is made by wood which is usually not elastic in nature due to that when you stuff some material in paper balloon more then it&#8217;s space radius and holding capacity limits, then the paper balloon material layout boundaries will break and whatever stuffed material that was inside of paper balloon may go out of it&#8217;s position or loose it&#8217;s shape for sure.</p>
<p>The space radius size inside of layout boundaries is as important as the layout material type and it&#8217;s quality as the bigger the size of space radius in 360°, the more things you&#8217;ll be able to put and move inside of space radius, which is why if you have bigger things to manage then you may need sufficient large space radius inside of layout boundaries else managing things can become bit difficult and you may eventually have to found much bigger space radius for sure, for example : let&#8217;s say there is like 10 meters distance space with only 5 meters height and width in that scenario you have a pole which height is 10 meters and you want put that in stand in posture on 5 metre height space radius, Will you be able to do it? It&#8217;s not possible isn&#8217;t it? As the space radius which we have has insufficient height space radius, but in that situation we may instead able to fit up pole in flat position as per the distance of space radius right? That&#8217;s why at the end you have to choose and get space radius and it&#8217;s layout structure boundaries as per your needs as well as the shape and size of things to manage space effectively.</p>
<p>When you have sufficient space radius, you&#8217;ll be able to store and manage things quite conveniently, if you do not have sufficient space radius you&#8217;ll get space shortage issues which makes it difficult and hard even impossible to store and manage certain things which are bigger than size of your space radius, that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s always important to have enough space radius else you may struggle and face issues to do things later in future, anyway as said earlier there are different types of space but the one that we said above is physical one which is visible that you can simply feel and see with your eyes isn&#8217;t it? when you build layout boundaries on top of space and then from outside of layout boundaries, will you be able to see and check space radius? It&#8217;s not possible isn&#8217;t it? unless the layout that we build on the top of space is transparent right? If it&#8217;s not then you have to manually go inside of layout boundaries to see, check, manage things available on your space radius.</p>
<p>You may think it&#8217;s no big deal to enter inside of layout boundaries to see things available on space radius, it may be not if space radius is small in size but if it&#8217;s large then it will be pretty difficult to see and track them which is why if you&#8217;re someone who for whatever reasons or purposes have to check space radius regularly then it&#8217;s better to have transparent layout boundaries, if you don&#8217;t have still you&#8217;ll be able to check and manage space radius using certain tools and technologies that we build over the years specifically for this like by noting placements and names of things available on space radius so that when you enter space radius the very next time you will be able to find them quickly and then comes high tech robots and live surveillance cameras by using them you will not only able to check and keep track of things available on your space radius but also move, destroy, damage, change, modify and transform things efficiently.</p>
<p>We as said earlier there are different types of space isn&#8217;t it? The above one which we discussed is about physical space that you may feel and see around you, now we got our basics about space, so now in the context of this article, let&#8217;s move on to digital space which has some features and characteristics of physical space but it is in digital form so you can&#8217;t directly feel or see it instead many supported electronic devices like personal computers, PDAs, smartphones etc were able to feel, detect, access, and see digital space provided in various electronic technology products like memory cards, pendrives, HDDs, SDDs etc when connected to them so by utilising such electronic devices, you can simply access and experience the digital space but wait it will be not like physical space, you can&#8217;t directly view, occupy and do anything on digital space radius even if digital space providing electronic product is openly transparent in physical space.</p>
<p>Even though, technically digital space is also part and is on top of physical space but we can say digital space is different or parallel universe inside of physical space with it&#8217;s own nature, environment, limits, controls, capacity and technologies etc, digital space at present is only able to store digital format files, at the end digital space and anything thing that occupies it usually will be in binary format which will be in two digits 0, 1, 1,0 that humans can&#8217;t translate which is why we use electronic devices, they can read and understand binary format and convert it to human readable format so that you will be able to better manage digital space well, but wait you can&#8217;t simply right out access and see digital space by connecting it&#8217;s providing gadget to electronic device instead you have to use softwares developed using programming languages like C++, Java, Python, Go etc as bridge to connect and do anything on digital space, gotcha?</p>
<p>Softwares are also digital things which are stored in digital space, but when executed they by using necessary device drivers and hardware technologies will act as layer of bridge between electronic device and digital space to show you everything about digital space and whatever digital things occupied it&#8217;s digital space radius vividly, the softwares which let you connect, access, view and do anything on your digital space from electronic devices are popularly known as file managers and file explorers, thought we already have a lot of file managers available for most electronic devices but finding quite right best and advanced file manager for smartphone can be challenging task for sure isn&#8217;t it? If you are looking out for some pretty good file manager for smartphone then you&#8217;re now at right place, recently we got to know about amazing feature rich file manager named Owl Files for smartphones that not just let you connect with your device local digital space but also access network shares, cloud servers and cloud storages etc, so do you like it? are you interested in Owl Files? If yes then let&#8217;s explore more.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Who doesn&#8217;t want to save space and network data on smartphones and [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/how-to-encode-videos-to-hevc-x265-format-using-google-colab.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/how-to-encode-videos-to-hevc-x265-format-using-google-colab.webp" alt="how-to-encode-videos-to-hevc-x265-format-using-google-colab" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>Who doesn&#8217;t want to save space and network data on smartphones and PCs, usually a lot of people do isn&#8217;t it? Unless they have big storage and data plan right? Majority of people especially in developing countries like india, bhutan, singapore and brazil etc, most likely not just buy low end mobiles and PCs which have limited space but also connect to limited network data plans with validity of one or few months, are you one of them? If so then you may probably download low quality data size and compressed files to save network data and regularly time to time delete old files to save storage on device right?</p>
<p>It is bit hard and time taking process for sure isn&#8217;t it? As though there are apps in PCs and smartphones which are able to automatically delete unused small and large files, but at the end sometimes you have to manually verify and delete them, so that important required files will not be lost as if they lost sometimes recovering them is bit difficult and even impossible isn&#8217;t it? that makes sense we must always be careful when dealing with such stuff, but thing is sometimes you may don&#8217;t want to delete any existing files at all yet still you may have to delete them forefully to free up device space for new files.</p>
<p>Generally, majority of people who have limited device storage space delete old files for new ones, thought we can use cloud hosting or streaming apps, but for that you need fast high data cap limit or unlimited data network, if you don&#8217;t have them then it may be not possible for you to upload or stream most large size stuff online so in-order to save device storage you may like a lot of people around the world have to download or stream low quality files or compressed files and archives right? It will for sure definitely save device space and network data.</p>
<p>But, thing is not all files will be compressed and provided online even if you found required compressed files or achives online or offline, when you uncompress them they&#8217;ll revert back to original size, so to store and manage them you need sufficient device space, it&#8217;s possible you may think that if i have high data cap network then I can simply download large files and compress them to save space for new ones but thing is compression of files require high end PC or smartphone so only when you have them it&#8217;ll work flawlessly, else you have to compromise and use low quality and less data size files which will work but may not give full-fledged usage or experience.</p>
<p>Even though, there are large percentage of people who don&#8217;t care much about quality of files when they are less in size but sometimes it is important and necessary to have full quality and size files else it can be issue and bit disappointing as well isn&#8217;t it? There are a lot of people who care and want to have high quality full sizes files either it&#8217;s videos, documents, images etc, are you one of them? If so are you unable to download and use high quality full sizes files due to limited device storage and network data? but still somehow want to download and use high quality full size files? then you&#8217;re now at right place.</p>
<p>We are now going to say you how you can download and store high quality full size files even with limited storage space devices and data cap networks, As you may know each file is available in different formats like for instance when it comes to images, you&#8217;ll find top formats, like png, jpeg, gif, tiff etc, so in the case of images when you make a high quality image in .png format it&#8217;s size will be high but when you convert .png format image to .webp image format you&#8217;ll have same image quality but with drastic reduction in file size thanks to it&#8217;s lossy compression algorithm technology, so at the end even if you choose .webp over .png still visibility will be same and in addition you&#8217;ll save device storage and data on the go.</p>
<p>In sense, there are certain file formats similar to .webp, with them you&#8217;ll get full quality data but at quite less size thanks to their algorithm technologies, since past few decades people around the world got used to digital file formats out of them digital images and videos are most used ones, in this context of article if we look into videos, there are many different video container formats like .mp4, .3gp, .mkv etc, each video container format has it&#8217;s own pros and cons mainly they differ in size as well due to underlying algorithm technologies, isn&#8217;t that fascinating?</p>
<p>In this digital era, thought we have different video container formats but if you care about video size then what matters most is how it is coded, since long time most videos are encoded in h.264 basically AVC aka advanced video coding format a quite popular video compression codec primarily used for bluray discs, but since past few decades it is being used in almost all video container formats, h.264 codec basically lowers the bitrate of video without reducing its quality, thought h.264 provide pretty good video compression but if you&#8217;re tight on device storage space and data network then h.264 encoded videos may feel like large file size ones for sure.</p>
<p>Do you know about h.264/AVC videos, have you used them? You may probably unknowingly got in touch with them as web is highly filled with them, if you&#8217;re satisfied with it&#8217;s video file size then it&#8217;s fine but if you don&#8217;t then you may probably already looking for an alternative right? If so then there is hevc aka high efficiency video coding h.265 codec that&#8217;s basically replacement and evolution of h.264 with like 50% more video compression rate so that you&#8217;ll get video files in half size with no reduction in visual quality due to that you can download even with limited data cap network and store them on quite low storage space devices, fabulous right?</p>
<p>However, thought videos despite their container formats when encoded with hevc h.265 video codec, you&#8217;ll find 50% reduction in size but the problem here is not all videos are available in .h265 codec and uploaded on web, so at the end if you want certain video with hevc .x265 codec then you have to encode it yourself using certain softwares like ffmpeg, but thing is encoding use a lot of RAM, so if you don&#8217;t have high end PC or smartphone then it may take long time to encode and convert even small videos to hevc h.265, isn&#8217;t that bit disappointing, It can be but don&#8217;t worry recently we got to know about a simple method by using that you can encode any size video file to hevc .h265, excited?</p>
<p>Colab, have you ever heard of this? It&#8217;s basically a platform provided by Google, Colab is a hosted Jupyter Notebook service that requires no setup to use and provides free access to computing resources, including GPUs and TPUs, thanks to that some developers provided a Google Colab notebook script that you can use for free to encode videos uploaded on Google Drive to hevc .265, but wait are you thinking all this upload and convert stuff consume network data? don&#8217;t worry Google Colab use it&#8217;s cloud servers to encode videos including that we will be using telegram bot to upload our videos to Drive, so you only use network data when you want to download encoded videos on device from drive, so do you like it? are you interested? If yes then let&#8217;s explore more.</p>
<p><strong>• How to encode videos to hevc .265 codec using Google Colab •</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/1_how-to-encode-videos-to-hevc-x265-format-using-google-colab.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/1_how-to-encode-videos-to-hevc-x265-format-using-google-colab.webp" alt="1_how-to-encode-videos-to-hevc-x265-format-using-google-colab" width="400" /></a></strong></p>
<p>&#8211; First, get a direct link of file from web using browser or download manager like 1DM then send it to uploader bots like the one above on telegram, they will provide them as file, done? Let&#8217;s proceed.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2_how-to-encode-videos-to-hevc-x265-format-using-google-colab.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2_how-to-encode-videos-to-hevc-x265-format-using-google-colab.webp" alt="2_how-to-encode-videos-to-hevc-x265-format-using-google-colab" width="400" /></a></strong></p>

<p>&#8211; Now use this Google Colab <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/Ptibouc77/FFMPEG-HEVC-AAC-Google-Colab/blob/master/FFMPEG_HEVC_AAC.ipynb" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">FFMPEG HEVC</a> script to encode videos to hevc .h265 and upload to your GDrive.</p>
<p>Atlast, this are just highlighted features of FFMPEG script there may be many hidden features in-build that provides you external benefits to give the ultimate usage experience, anyway if you want one of the best Google Colab script to encode videos to h.265 then at present FFMPEG HEVC is one of the best on go worthy choice.</p>
<p>Overall, Google Colab by default has light mode, it has clean and simple interface that ensures user friendly experience, but in any project there is always space for improvement so let&#8217;s wait and see will Google Colab get any major UI changes in future to make it even more better, as of now Google Colab is impressive.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is definitely important to mention FFMPEG HEVC is one of the very few Google Colab scripts available out there on world wide web of internet that let you encode videos to not just regular hevc .h265 but also HEVC 10 bit including that it let you convert them to .mkv or .mp4 video container formats, yes indeed if you&#8217;re searching for such Google Colab script then FFMPEG HEVC definitely has potential to become your new favourite.</p>
<p>Finally, this is how you can upload videos to GDrive and encode videos to hevc h.265 using FFMPEG HEVC Google Colab notebook script, are you an existing user of FFMPEG HEVC? If yes do say your experience and mention why you like it in our comment section below, see ya 🙂</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/how-to-migrate-from-blogger-to-hugo-and-host-site-on-github-pages.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/how-to-migrate-from-blogger-to-hugo-and-host-site-on-github-pages.webp" width="400" alt="how-to-migrate-from-blogger-to-hugo-and-host-site-on-github-pages"></a></p>
<p>Blogging, that&#8217;s not an easy job isn&#8217;t it? If you&#8217;re blogger then you probably know how exactly it feels to take up blogging right? If you&#8217;re passionate about it then for sure, it will be exciting but at the same the more and more blogging you do, the higher you have to dig into subject to present  information accordingly to meet upto your quality standards and targets as much as possible, it will be challenging task that&#8217;s what makes it enjoyable and yeah for sure it&#8217;ll let you learn and pratice various skills like for instance content writing, proof reader, presentation, writing skills and many more on the go, which are useful in any era as since ancient times we&#8217;ve been using written communication and in future will use it as well as it&#8217;s quite necessary so the better you present the more amazing it will be isn&#8217;t it? We bloggers spend a lot of time like hours even days and months to write and present information in a way to reach our and viewer expectations thought there will many hurdles in doing it but yeah it has to done right? the more time, focus, concentration, skill and hard work we put in to accomplish writing content, the more experienced and skilled will become to be considered as professional Bloggers.</p>
<p>Do you know? Who exactly is Blogger, if you&#8217;re new to this stuff then for you in simple Blogger is basically modern word used for person who does blogging on internet site linked with certain Web2 or Web3 address like for ex : yoursite.com, while blogging is basically making and publishing text written digital content on internet, is it clear? I hope so anyway a blogger can take up multiple roles cause as said earlier blogging teachs you many skills on the flow mainly speeding up the typing, entrepreneurship, management, etc same as like running own newspaper but blogging is less cost, more flexibility and fast reach to people around the world, so a blogger can be said as journalist as well at the end both are similar like in Newspaper even if we write good content and don&#8217;t manage and maintain well, it will start to decline and eventually downfall likewise in blogging as well even if you write pretty good content still if you manage other factors of site badly like user interface and user experience etc then blog will start to decline and eventually downfall which is why optimization of not just content but also blogging site is necessary to lead up in ranks and attract visitors globally.</p>
<p>Ranking is everywhere right? We can rank almost anything in blogging like content, quality, writing, user interface and user experience of blog, what not you can rate almost everything, the better ranking your blog has the better and more chances it has to rank on search engines like Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo etc, in sense basically search engine optimisation inshort SEO is important for growth of blog which is why a lot of bloggers try their best and keep on improving seo to get high score so that the blog and it&#8217;s articles will rank on top of the search engines which will not just increase organic traffic of blog but also give benefit in many ways like in improving brand value and domain authority etc, that&#8217;s why a lot of bloggers use many methods to increase seo though there is both good &#038; bad ones, at the end good methods are better and it will keep blog in safe zone, there are many ways to improve seo out of them speed of blog the higher it is the more you&#8217;ll get seo as people tends to view blogs which have less loading times, fast and responsive so if you are newbie blogger make sure your blog load everything in below 5 seconds to stay up in the charts of seo, gotcha?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t wanna bore you off with details how internet and world wide web works and came into existence that&#8217;s another story for that you can read our related articles, here in this context will be focusing on evolution of blogs, at first in early era of world wide web almost all people used to make and publish content on static site blogs developed primarily using high level programming language HTML &#8211; hypertext markup language by hosting and serving blog contents from computer, as HTML is less resources blog used to be small thus it used to load pretty fast on world wide web browsers, but as time goes in order to evolve a lot of people started using CSS &#8211; cascading styling sheets, Javascript, PHP and some other programming languages to make and improve structure of blogs, but the problem here is they add up some more resources and external load on blog, they will reduce blog load time thought optimization like minify and compression of blog code used to improve load times but thing is at the end making, managing, and running blog from own computer used to be bit hard and difficult task for sure.</p>
<p>Especially, if you&#8217;re newbie and not web developer setting up static site and manually building and hosting them on your personal computer and serving them on web can be challenging task, it not just takes a lot of time but also can be quite expensive when you&#8217;re site has large scale traffic, which is why a lot of people back in time wanted simple and better method to create blog and publish content on web, as there is such huge demand and usage of internet rising rapidly around the world, many companies to supply tried to build digital software portals to simplify all this, in that process we got revolutionary cms aka content management platforms which are easy to utilize with them you can easily create dynamic blog sites and publish content on web in few minutes as most cms platforms offer not just cloud server hosting for blog but also provide all in one tools with simple intuitive user interface and experience to manage blog on the go thanks to that large percentage of people shifted and started using cms platforms that led to evolution of Web 1.0 to 2.0.</p>
<p>Yes, indeed emerging technologies will evolve web like concept of crypto currency and decentralisation etc directly and indirectly played role in evolution of internet to decentralised web 3.0, but at present internet is mostly web 2.0 where we use centralized cms platforms, thought there are many free and paid cms platforms but out of them Blogger by Google and WordPress by Automatic inc. are free and popular ones used by millions of users worldwide, are you one of them? If you&#8217;re then you may probably know  Blogger and WordPress use number of server-side programming languages, databases, scripts, software components etc in front and backend to publicize your blog and it&#8217;s content on web, thought if you take good care in optimizing your blog site making it less size and resources then it will be fast but in any case dynamic server side blog site and content has more resources so they usually take more time to load than static ones which is why a lot of people who want the blog to load faster instead make and use static site blogs.</p>
<p>However, as said earlier unless you&#8217;re developer it&#8217;s hard to maintain static blog sites atleast you need to have geeky level smartness to cope up and run static blog sites which if you have already then all is well, but if you don&#8217;t then cms platforms like Blogger or WordPress are way better choice, but incase you for whatever reason can&#8217;t, unable or don&#8217;t want to use cms platforms anymore instead want much better and simple way to build and use static blog sites then we have static site generators though in early days of web we don&#8217;t have them but as time goes people want simple and fast way to build static sites as there is demand to supply number of developers made and released amazing static site generators like Hugo and Jekyll etc which you can install and run on your server to build and serve static sites in few minutes, so do you wanna use them? If you do then in order to do that first you have to import and convert blog articles from Blogger or WordPress to compatible meta format of static site generators.</p>
<p>Even though, at present there are many static site generators but in this context will be discussing about Hugo an free and open source static site generator written using programming language Go created by Steve Francia back in year 2013 after that it&#8217;s development is continued by Bjørn Erik Pedersen with few other contributors, thought at the end as said earlier generally all static sites are fast but when it comes to build time Hugo is promoted and better known for blazing fast site build times then most static site generators, so if you have big site with a lot of articles then Hugo may have slight better edge in comparison to bit slow build time static site generators like Jekyll, anyhow it depends on various factors and mainly it&#8217;s user specific, kindly choose the one which works for you, if you choose to use Hugo then you&#8217;re at right place, now we are going to show you how you can migrate from Blogger or WordPress to Hugo with GitHub Pages, so do you like it? are you interested in Hugo, If yes then let&#8217;s explore more.</p>

<p>Well, now let&#8217;s move on to setting up Hugo site using Ubuntu.</p>
<p><strong>• How to setup Github and build Hugo site using Ubuntu • </strong></p>
<p><i>~ Enter and execute below commands ~</i></p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>sudo apt install gh</strong></p>

<p>&#8211; <strong>hugo new site &#8220;</strong> yoursitename <strong>&#8220;</strong></p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>cd &#8220;</strong> your site name <strong>&#8220;</strong></p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>git init</strong> ( this adds empty repository and set branch always to master )</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>git submodule add</strong> ( theme url ) <strong> themes/</strong> ( theme name ) | replace with your ones |</p>
<p>&#8211; ( In above command just change theme url and theme name ) </p>
<p><i>~ Now you have to add Hugo theme of your choice ( I&#8217;m using Blist ) ~</i></p>
<p>&#8211; Get hugo themes from <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">themes.gohugo.io</a> or from <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoThemes" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">GitHub repository</a> etc.</p>
<p>Note : each hugo theme has it&#8217;s own guide, make sure to check it from official sources before you dive into this stuff for instance Blist theme setup will go like below and it may work for many other hugo themes.</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>cd themes</strong></p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>cd blist-hugo-theme</strong> ( your theme name )</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>ls</strong></p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>cp package.json package-lock.json ~/blank</strong> ( add your hugo site name root directory )</p>
<p>&#8211; Now go back to root directory of your hugo site using command : <strong>cd ..</strong> twice.</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>echo &#8216;theme = &#8220;blist-hugo-theme&#8221;&#8216; &gt;&gt; config.yml</strong> ( it will set theme to blist, you can replace with your theme name )</p>
<p>&#8211; I&#8217;m using config.toml for this theme, but you may use hugo.toml as well, it changes syntax of code, so keep that in mind.</p>
<p>&#8211; Once we set theme in config.yml, you can add extra code which you can get from the hugo theme Github public repository.</p>

<p>&#8211; In config.toml ( don&#8217;t forget to change <strong>baseURL</strong> to your GitHub respository, it&#8217;s important else your blog and imported articles will not work for sure. ) </p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>git config user.email</strong> ( GitHub email )</p>

<p>&#8211; <strong>su</strong> ( enter root mode on Ubuntu if npm install &#038; postcss got some errors ) </p>
<p>&#8211; it asks you to enter root password, if you didn&#8217;t already set any root password, set it by using command : <strong>sudo passwd root</strong> ) </p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>npm install</strong> ( Again )</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>npm i -g postcss-cli</strong> ( Again )</p>

<p>&#8211; <strong>cp ~/folder/* ~/sitename/content/</strong>  ( replace folder with your folder name in root directory, where you imported your articles and then your hugo site name ) </p>
<p>&#8211; you can also create sub folder in content directory using <strong>mkdir &#8221; sub-folder &#8220;</strong> and import your articles over there as well.</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>cd  ..</strong> ( go to hugo site root directory )</p>

<p>&#8211; Now, wait for a minute and go to your GitHub pages site, it should mostly work if it didn&#8217;t check GitHub Actions for any type of errors and then fix them by getting support from Hugo Forums or support groups.</p>
<p>Bingo, you successfully created a Hugo site using Ubuntu and GitHub pages.</p>
<p>Atlast, this are just highlighted features of Hugo and GitHub pages, there may be many hidden features in-build that provides you external benefits to give the ultimate usage experience, anyway this is how you can migrate from Blogger to Hugo hosting on GitHub pages. </p>
<p>Overall, Hugo comes with many super cool themes, it may be user friendly setup and code synax that may works for web developers and geeks, that ensures quite productive experience, but in any project there is always space for improvement so let&#8217;s wait and see will Hugo get any major UI changes in future to make it even more better, as of now Hugo is nice.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is definitely worth to mention Hugo is one of the very few static page generators out there on world wide web of internet, which promote itself for blazing fast page build times better than most other static site generators, yes indeed if you&#8217;re searching for such static page generator then Hugo is worthy choice.</p>
<p>Finally, this is how you can migrate from Blogger or WordPress by hosting Hugo on GitHub pages, Hugo a free and open source static site generator, are you an existing user of Hugo? If yes do say your experience and mention why you like it in our comment section below, see ya </p>

<p>CyanogenMod have you ever heard of this custom rom? If you&#8217;re into Android stuff  since long time then you may probably do isn&#8217;t it? CyanogenMod is basically once up on a time most popular and top Android custom rom used by like millions of people, it used to provide a lot of pretty amazing customizations and features through custom roms for number of years of various Android versions for a lot of devices, which are usually not available on stock Android builds released by Google and many other device makers aka OEMs isn&#8217;t that cool? due to such awesomeness of CyanogenMod it not just inspired many third party developers around the world to build their own Android custom roms but also made them to use CyanogenMod as base for majority of custom roms due to that the fanbase and tech community of CyanogenMod grown exponentially to the level that back in year 2016 well known big india&#8217;s mobile maker company Micromax partnered with CyanogenMod to release it&#8217;s Yu Yuphoria series smartphones with CyanogenMod thanks to that Micromax Yu smartphone series recieved quite enough attention and sells in market, but thing is later on CyanogenMod was discontinued by it&#8217;s team due to some internal conflicts within Cyanogen Inc., yet thankfully many members in order to revive Cyanogenmod have contributed to develop and launch it&#8217;s fabulous sucessor named LineageOS.</p>
<p>LineageOS like it&#8217;s predecessor CyanogenMod is an foss aka free and open source software, but thing is it&#8217;s not customization oriented custom rom instead it focused on minimal useful changes and kept things original as possible, thanks to that many people and third party developers who like to use and make stock Android custom roms started using LineageOS as base, due to that now it received huge userbase and considered as one of the best custom roms available for Android devices, but thing is not everyone like to use pure stock Android like custom roms isn&#8217;t it? there are certain percentage of people who instead want and prefer to utilize extensive feature rich customizable custom roms, thought there are many of them, but at the end it&#8217;s quite difficult to integrate each and everything in one right? which is why many third party developers cherry pick features from different stock as well as custom roms to add and build their own custom roms as they want and for users around the world accordingly so that users can choose and switch custom roms as per needs easily.</p>
<p>Even though, since long time we have thousands of super cool feature rich custom roms integrated with modern technologies, which can be installed on any compatible hardware Android devices simply through adb fastboot or custom recoveries like TWRP, but thing is at the end for whatever reason there&#8217;s chance custom roms may didn&#8217;t satisfy in one way or another isn&#8217;t it? like for instance you may be felt stock OEM roms are much better than most custom roms in terms of better performance and usability right? In anycase pure stock Android roms doesn&#8217;t provide things which you&#8217;ll get on custom roms, so if you&#8217;re someone who is unable to use custom roms, but still want to get and can&#8217;t get over with customizations and features of custom roms then since long time main thing and alternative to custom roms we have is to root Android devices using softwares like Chainfire SuperSu or Magisk etc, they&#8217;ll provide write access to system partition so that you will be able to do core system level changes on Android as you like to get desired output and do almost all things extensively on the go.</p>
<p>However, thought rooting Android devices is pretty easy task as all you have to do is basically unlock device bootloader and then you can simply even root it without PC using one click root mobile apps like  Kingoroot or Framaroot etc, but thing is in order to customize and add features on Android devices you either have to be a skilled developer or person with well knowledge on structure of Android else you may hard or softbrick devices which is sometimes irreparable, so if you&#8217;re newbie then it&#8217;s better to stay out of it or deal root system level things carefully on Android to be in safe zone, as it can mess up things severely instead you can use root apps, thanks to many third party developers who over the years already made and released many root apps for various purposes to not just customize and get new features on Android but also do a lot more stuff like change user interface or get dolby atmos and digital surround sound etc isn&#8217;t that fabulous? At the end there is no doubt we have a lot of fantastic root apps and tools, but the one that mesmerized and not just changed the way users customize and get new features on Android device but also leveled up them is Xposed Framework.</p>
<p>Xposed Framework is basically free and open source root app for Android devices created by XDA recognized developer Rovo89 back in early rise of Android era, since the beginning of Xposed Framework it received huge userbase and over the years got immense popularity among Android users thanks to it&#8217;s functionalities, Xposed Framework has many interesting and useful modules build by third party developers around the world, when you use Xposed Framework with modules they&#8217;ll inject certain code directly into selected and enabled Android system or users apps, so that you can not only just lock or unlock stuff to enable or disable restrictions and things on Android devices, but also you will be able to customize and get new features effectively, which is why Xposed Framework has long been must have root app on Android devices.</p>
<p>Usually, as time goes technologies keep on evolving as per requirements and needs of market as people usually want and expect more out of their products same goes for Xposed Framework, even thought it&#8217;s in initial stage itself is pretty good one, yet evolution to next level as per demand of users is necessary to cope up and stay up-to-date in market accordingly  which is necessary, that&#8217;s why Rovo89 allowed anyone to make and provide their own forms of Xposed Framework so that people can use it quite more efficiently and effectively, thanks to the fact Xposed Framework is free and open source app it&#8217;s code is publicly available as repository on contributive development platform GitHub, due to that anyone from internet can not just commit their code to improve Xposed Framework, but also can use it&#8217;s code to develop own forms of Xposed Framework like for instance numerous third party developers over the years already started developing and releasing  various forms of Xposed Framework like  for instance to name few top and popular ones EdXposed and LSPosed etc.</p>
<p>Even though, there are many various forms of Xposed Framework but the one that we are now specifically going to discuss is  LSPosed available as module for Riru and  Zygisk to be installed on Magisk rooted Android devices, which support Android 8.1 and above devices with Magisk v24+, Lsposed has it&#8217;s own framework based on it&#8217;s hooks developers can provide Xposed modules, but a module based on LSPosed framework is fully compatible with original Xposed Framework, and vice versa at the same time Xposed Framework-based module will work well with LSPosed framework, isn&#8217;t that amazing? at the end any form of Xposed Framework you use most of them require root access and they modify apps at runtime without touching apps which is good as it has number of advantages mainly It&#8217;s easy to undo as all the changes are done in memory, you just need to deactivate module and reboot to get your original system back and multiple modules can do changes to the same part of the system or app and many more.</p>
<p>Xposed Framework and it&#8217;s various forms like LSPosed are undoubtedly pretty useful in customizing and get new features on Android devices but thing is as said earlier they all require root due to their design structure and functionality thought it&#8217;s easy to acquire root access but thing is it&#8217;s not always possible to root isn&#8217;t it? you may be for whatever reasons don&#8217;t like and want to root Android devices right? mainly because you must unlock bootloader to root which some OEMs don&#8217;t allow like Asus, IQOO etc including that even if you have such device which has unlockable bootloader still at the end rooting Android devices voilates warranty unless you live in european union, so if you are someone who can&#8217;t root Android but still want to use Xposed Framework then you are at right place, LSPosed is free and open source same as Xposed Framework thanks to that a third party developer JasonKhew96 build and released non- root Xposed framework named LSPatch extending from LSPosed, so that you can do Xposed Framework stuff without root on Android devices, isn&#8217;t that fantastic? so do you like it? are you interested? If yes let&#8217;s explore more.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[HTC Dream G1 is the world&#8217;s first handheld smartphone powered by top [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/kernelsu-a-kernel-based-android-root-alternative-to-magisk.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/kernelsu-a-kernel-based-android-root-alternative-to-magisk.webp" alt="kernelsu-a-kernel-based-android-root-alternative-to-magisk" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>HTC Dream G1 is the world&#8217;s first handheld smartphone powered by top search giant Google&#8217;s free and open source mobile operating system &#8220;Android&#8221; developed and released by top search engine giant Google back in year 2008 in partnership with well known Taiwanese mobile maker HTC corporation though Google over past decade to progress and evolve done a lot of developments by adapting to latest technologies on Androd with updates and upgrades to improve as well as advance it further to next level but it is actually founded by Andy Rubens back in year 2003 which was later acquired by Google for $50 million dollors in year 2005 at that time it&#8217;s quite big investment that eventually turned out fruitful as Android is revolutionary and worked well to compete with Apple inc&#8217;s mobile operating system iOS powered iPhone series smartphones and number of other operating system powered devices around the world.</p>
<p>The early first versions of Android 1.0 and it&#8217;s update Android 1.1 doesn&#8217;t have any public codenames though some pre-1.0 milestone builds are internally tagged as Astro Boy and Blender but eventually starting from 2.0 Eclair Google started naming each new upgrade of Android with desert names known as code names like Android 3.0 as Honey Comb and Android 4.0 as icecream sandwich and so on with super cool useful new features and bug fixes on new updates and upgrades thanks to that a lot of people like and prefer to get and use Android including that back then Android seems have potential and worthy competitor to Apple inc&#8217;s closed source operating system &#8220;iOS&#8221; which is why many mobile makers around the world whoever unable to use iOS or make an alternative mobile operating system in time started using Android building their own custom versions utilizing the Android open source project aka AOSP to powerup their devices and make business with them globally.</p>
<p>Android is free and open source mobile operating system thanks to that most makers were able make and provide smartphones at less price due to that we got to see feature rich less expensive Android powered smartphones where is iOS powered iPhones are quite expensive which is why majority of people around the world like and prefer Android devices over iOS ones because of that eventually as time goes Android got huge userbase and now has more than 70% marketshare worldwide but thing is though Android is open ecosystem and by default it&#8217;s more customizable than closed ecosystem &#8220;iOS&#8221; yet still back in beginning Android used to be basic due to that users won&#8217;t be able to do much stuff so back then certain users whoever want to somehow get more out of Android started looking for ways at that time as Android is free and open source some developers found methods to root many Android smartphones to customize system well but rooting Android devices voids warrenty unless you live in EU.</p>
<p>In computers you will get open access to system partition and by simply installing or running certain install softwares as super administrator you can do things at core level and customize it extremely and extensively but where is incase of Android powered smartphones though you will get read access to system partition but write access is restricted for device security and privacy to keep you in safe zone which is pretty good but limits many capabilities and capacity of Android smartphones isn&#8217;t that bit disappointing? which is why many people want to break all the limitations of Android to utilize most functionalities of devices efficiently and effectively so for them as there is demand to supply many third party developers around the world created many amazing rooting methods and softwares like to name few kingoroot, framaroot etc to root number of Android devices in 1 click with or without PC but thing is though they does work and do job well yet still many users want better and more reliable alternative rooting software at that time we got Chainfire&#8217;s SuperSu.</p>
<p>There are many rooting softwares out of them Kingoroot is top and most popular one which worked well as by using it&#8217;s app itself users were able to root most Android smartphones in one click within 5 to 10 minutes of time but thing is as time goes Google to progress and evolve done alot of developments on Android with updates and upgrades to improve and advance it to further next level in that process they fixed bugs basically loopholes and tightened the level of security available on Android due to that it become quite hard for Kingoroot and other rooting softwares to root latest versions of Android though there are few rooting apps build to root latest Android versions but thing is most of them used to soft brick Android devices so at that time many people stopped using one click root apps and softwares then started choosing device specific Chainfire&#8217;s SuperSu root methods from trusted platforms like XDA but thing is for whatever reasons Chainfire discontinued development of SuperSu so a lot of users begin looking for way better Android rooting software alternative to SuperSu at that time we got Magisk.</p>
<p>Magisk is free and open source modern systemless rooting software developed by TopJohnWu made to root Android 6.0 marshmallow and above smartphones which is considered as better and best alternative Android rooting software came in replacement of SuperSu that basically modify and patch boot image of Android and can root almost all Android powered smartphones with unlocked bootloader but thing is it doesn&#8217;t have any one click rooting software instead you must have PC or apps like Bugjaegar with adb tools to simply flash Magisk and root connected Android devices isn&#8217;t that easy? at the end at present Magisk is quite reliable top and popular Android rooting software widely utilized by people around the world but thing is Magisk is meant for latest Android devices and it patches original boot image to root that compromises device security thus it fail to pass safetynet due to that device and apps detect root thus many apps mainly banking related ones won&#8217;t run and work well though there are some workarounds to pass Safetynet and hide Magisk root like University Safetynet Fix, MagiskHide, Zygisk, Denylist, MagiskHide props etc yet still sometimes they do not work which is why some Android users since long time want way better and more sophisticated alternative to Magisk to root Android at that time we got KernelSU.</p>
<p>KernelSU as the name suggests is an kernel based Android rooting software that injects directly into kernel to handle processes and only work on KernelSU supported kernel Android devices so as you may know kernel work as bridge between hardware and software due to that you will get more reliable root that work much better than patched boot image based root methods like SuperSu and Magisk including that KernelSU as it&#8217;s kernel based root solution it provides core level device access with anonymity thanks to that you will get more control of root and most devices and apps usually won&#8217;t be able to detect root thus KernelSU can automatically pass Safetynet including that you will be able to install modules same as on Magisk but the problem with KernelSU is at present it doesn&#8217;t have wide device support though works best for old and lesser-known devices so you have to choose as per your needs accordingly.</p>
<p>Especially, the main advantage of KernelSU is it&#8217;s free and open sourced under GPL3 license and.by default bypass Selinux and provide whitelist control so only app that is granted root permission can access &#8220;su&#8221; other apps cannot perceive su including that KernelSU allows you to customize the uid, gid, groups, capabilities and SELinux rules of su and lock up the root power in a cage isn&#8217;t that amazing? but the problem here is you can only install KernelSU on supported kernels and the installation process of KernelSU on Android devices is can be complex for newbies as you either have to insall Kernel or complile one yourself according to guide but thing is compiling KernelSU supported GKI kernel is not easy one and things may go wrong unless you&#8217;re skilled developer with knowledge on structure of Android devices with ability to follow guide and fix things well at the end even if you have manage to get KernelSU just keep in mind KernelSU is on growing community and it does have loopholes like other root softwares which are continuously getting fixed, so do you like it? are you interested in KernelSU ? if yes let&#8217;s explore more.</p>
