										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ravynos-an-open-source-freebsd-operating-system-for-imac.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ravynos-an-open-source-freebsd-operating-system-for-imac.webp" width="400" alt="ravynos-an-open-source-freebsd-operating-system-for-imac"></a></p>
<p>There are millions of revolutionary inventions created by people around the world out of them Computer is one first founded by Charles Babbage who build world&#8217;s first Computer named Difference Engine at first most computers are build up of hardware based mechanical parts but later on when we entered in electricity era people and companies around the world invented electronic products for various purposes in that process we got electronic computers.</p>
<p>John Vincent Atanasoff invented world&#8217;s first electronic computer named ABC aka Atanasoff-Berry computer that can totally replace non-electronic computers after that alot of inventors and companies build and upgraded electronic computers to add more facilities and features by adapting to new technologies accordingly which can do real life tasks electronically.</p>
<p>In early year 1950s, General Motors created world&#8217;s first operating system basically software using number of programming languages for IBM computer to do programmed tasks after that many people and companies build thier own operating systems for computers.</p>
<p>However, in beginning computers are very big and expensive thus not everyone can afford them and they&#8217;re not home friendly as well but later on alot of inventors and companies for personal or commercial reasons reduced the size and price of computers due to them we got home friendly PCs aka personal computers.</p>
<p>PCs come with powerful hardware and operating systems where you can install more softwares to do tasks electronically and digitally if programmed correctly but at first most PCs used to run on CLI aka command line interface based operating systems where you have to type and send commands to use it which are very much used by many coders and developers.</p>
<p>Even though, comman people can also use CLI operating systems but not easy you have to learn command lines or even programming language itself based on operating system which is why Inventors and companies created GUI aka graphical user interface operating system where you can see things to access them easily using cursor enabled by PC mouse.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are numerous GUI based operating systems invented by developers and companies around the world over the years on PCs especially in 21st century of modern digital era we have advanced GUI based operating systems with integrated CLI where you can install more softwares by using them you can do almost all real life physical tasks digitally.</p>
<p>Apple inc. is popular american PC maker founded by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak who from start used closed source GUI based operating system for commercial reasons thus no one can check or use it&#8217;s  code as it is encrypted that may cause risk to your privacy and security which is why alot of people use open source operating system on PCs to be in safe zone.</p>
<p>In open source operating systems code is public where anyone can check and use code even contribute for development to improve or add more features as there is transparency you will get best privacy and security in every corner of usage so due to that majority of developers and companies over the years created alot of open source operating systems for PCs.</p>
<p>Thankfully, in year 2000 Apple inc. also released it&#8217;s own unix like open source operating system named DarwinOS based on code of FreeBSD, NextStep, Mach open source operating systems but later on for whatever reasons after 1 year they again on PC switched to closed source operating system named MacOS.</p>
<p>iMac is popular PC series from Apple inc. which gone through rapid developments for more then two decades and uses MacOS for long time that many users like to use but some people especially those who prefer Darwin want MacOS to be open open source operating system on iMac.</p>
<p>It is possible that Apple inc. may open source MacOS in future which is right now closed source because of commercial reasons but in case you don&#8217;t want to use MacOS yet like iMac or you may want to try open source operating system on iMac without loosing feel of MacOS then for you there is RavynOS.</p>
<p>RavynOS formerly known as airyxOS is an secure, stable and performance focused FOSS aka free and  open source operating system derivative of FreeBSD with similar user interface of MacOS which you can install on any PC but the main speciality of RavynOS is It has some compatibility with Darwin and x86-64/arm64 with eventually support for arm macOS (Mach-O) libraries thus you can compile a Mac application on ravynOS and run it, isn&#8217;t cool?</p>
<p>In sense, you can&#8217;t directly Install and run MacOS .dmg softwares or you can say apps on ravynOS because it&#8217;s based on FreeBSD but it uses many components of Darwin OS which is still in development thus it can compile and run few MacOS and Darwin OS apps on RavynOS.</p>
<p>Anyhow, the main purpose of ravynOS is to provide better security and security at that same time set you free from Apple inc. ecosystem and especially as ravynOS is based on FreeBSD it can also run FreeBSD ports and Linux apps that support Waydroid seamlessly, so do you like it? are you interested in RavynOS? If yes let&#8217;s explore more.</p>
<p>Note : ravynOS is still in Alpha developer preview stage which means development is in progress so you may find bugs or limited number of features but eventually ravynOS may fix all issues and release more interesting and exciting features in future, so do you like it? are interested in ravynOS ? If yes let&#8217;s explore more.</p>

<p>Atlast, this are just highlighted features of ravynOS there may be many hidden features in-build that provides you external benefits to give the ultimate usage experience, anyway if want one of the best open free and open source operating system based on FreeBSD with interface similar to MacOS then ravynOS at present is on go worthy choice.</p>
</p>
<p>Overall, ravynOS comes with light by default, it has clean and simple well designed intutive interface that ensures user friendly experience, but in any project there is always space for improvement so let&#8217;s wait and see will ravynOS get any major UI changes in future to make it even more better, as of now ravynOS is assuring for sure.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is definitely worth to mention ravynOS is one of the very few open source operating system based on FreeBSD with resemblence and ability to compile and install some MacOS libraries, yes indeed if you&#8217;re searching for such open source operating system then ravynOS has potential to become your new favourite.</p>
<p>Finally, this is ravynOS that provides finesse of MacOS and Freedom of FreeBSD, are you an existing user of ravynOS? If yes do say your experience and mention why and which feature of ravynOS you like the most in our comment section below, see ya 🙂</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/dahlia-the-worlds-first-flutter-ui-desktop-os-based-on-linux.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/dahlia-the-worlds-first-flutter-ui-desktop-os-based-on-linux.webp" width="400" alt="dahlia-the-worlds-first-flutter-ui-desktop-os-based-on-linux"></a></p>
<p>Charles Babbage, in year 1829 designed and build world first computer named difference engine which is an automatic mechanical calculator that can calculate and tabulate polynomial functions after that inventors around the world build numerous computers using latest and new technologies for various purposes accordingly.</p>
<p>John Vincent Atanasoff, a physicist and mathematician invented world&#8217;s first electronic computer named Atanasoff-Berry Computer (ABC) after that many inventors developed electronic computers by integrating operating systems basically softwares to increase and extend capabilities of computers.</p>
<p>Computers, in early 18th and 19th century are big and expensive but later on thanks to companies and visionary inventors they continuously developed computers due to that we got small size personal computers inshort PCs with new features and modern operating systems which can do almost all real life physical tasks electronically.</p>
<p>PC aka Personal computer used to be basic in begginings yet much better then big size computers but later on thanks to competition among companies in this capitalist world they gradually increased features of PCs due to that by start of 20th century we got powerful hardware and advanced operating system PCs.</p>
<p>Even though, operating systems are first limited to computers but eventually many companies started integrating operating systems on different electronic devices but operating systems on computers and smartphones are popular and widely used by people globally.</p>
<p>Now, in 21st century we have numerous powerful and advanced operating systems out there on internet for smartphones and desktops etc developed using numerous programming languages like C and C++, python etc and each one of them can have it&#8217;s own user interface in short UI as per liking and requirements of developers.</p>
<p>Majority of operating systems are GUI aka graphical user interface based and most people prefer and like to use GUI based operating systems as you can see and access things easily but some people especially alot of developers use CLI aka command line interface where you have to send commands to see and access things which is bit hard to use for sure, isn&#8217;t?</p>
<p>Anyhow, most PCs you can also call desktops and smartphones use GUI based operating system inshort OS and each GUI OS can have it&#8217;s own UI framework like for instance Microsoft Windows currently use WinUI 3 and Linux and it&#8217;s distributions like Ubuntu, Debian, Arch, Kali etc use GNOME, XFCE, MATE UI frameworks.</p>
<p>There are two types of operating systems closed and open source while on closed operating systems only developers can modify and change core structure of OS like it&#8217;s GUI framework but on open source operating systems anyone from internet can use it&#8217;s source and build ther own custom version of operating system with different UI and added features etc.</p>
<p>We have many GUI frameworks and each of them are developed using one or more programming languages according to it&#8217;s operating system but the problem with most GUI frameworks is they only support one or few specific operating systems so developers in order to build softwares for different operating systems have to use and rely on supported GUI frameworks.</p>
<p>It is definitely hard to use different GUI framework for each operating system but as there is no option developers for more then decade go in that way which is why developers take time to build and release software upgrades and updates bit late if they support multiple operating systems.</p>
<p>Thankfully, on Dec 4th, 2018 Google released Flutter a cross platform GUI framework with that you can build softwares for both deskop and mobile operating systems like Android, iOS, Mac OS, Linux, Windows etc thus developers can convieniently make modern rich GUI softwares easily and comfortably.</p>
<p>Flutter is written in Dart programming language that has potential to replace other GUI frameworks in near future which is now competing with other popular GUI frameworks like Kotlin which is why Google completely used Flutter to build user interface of it&#8217;s upcoming operating system Fuchsia OS that going to replace or become alternative to Android OS.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.techtracker.in/2022/07/what-happened-to-fuchsia-os-operating.html" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">+ What happened to Fuchsia OS, A operating system from Google.</a></strong></p>
<p>Fortunately, as Flutter is open source GUI framework any developer can make his own operating system with Flutter GUI framework even though many developers already making cross platforms apps but still almost all operating systems as base still not used GUI framework of Flutter.</p>
<p>Recently, we found world&#8217;s first open source desktop operating system named dahliaOS based on Linux that uses pangolin a desktop environment written in flutter which is an modern, secure, lightweight, privacy and security socused operating system that combines GNU/Linux and FuchsiaOS.</p>
<p>dahliaOS was announced on February 27, 2019 by Camden Bruce later on dahliaOS developers team added many features then released it&#8217;s first base version on August 8 , 2020 after that we got many dahliaOS updates with bug fixes and more features due to that dahliaOS is usable but dahliaOS is not based on Fuchsia OS.</p>
<p>In sense, dahliaOS look and feel like Fuchsia OS as it&#8217;s desktop environment pangolin is written in Flutter but in reality dahliaOS is not based on Flutter but the team of dahliaOS is working to make a desktop operating system of Fuschia OS which they didn&#8217;t started yet but may come in future so that we can use FuchsiaOS on desktops as well isn&#8217;t cool and amazing? so do you like it? are you interested in dahliaOS? If yes let&#8217;s explore more.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, Have you ever heard of custom ROMs or either custom software, [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/history-of-custom-roms.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" height="319" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/history-of-custom-roms.webp" width="320" alt="history-of-custom-roms"></a></p>
<p>Hi, Have you ever heard of custom ROMs or either custom software, if not now we are going to provide an comprehensive info about it.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s get started, customs ROMs is nothing but an modified software of an original software or customized and added some external features into the software from different ROMs that orginal smartphone stock software doesn&#8217;t have it.</p>
<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EF-G7zwOYeg/XgoCo7N9T7I/AAAAAAAAAVU/BP_hO7CXqOIPo_GkBWJQI0UVJ-rPaXz9QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/IMG_20191230_192836_083.jpg" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" height="319" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/1_history-of-custom-roms.webp" width="320" alt="1_history-of-custom-roms"></a></p>
<p>Its all started in 2002 when XDA developers website launched on 20 December for developers to post regarding various subjects like root, theming and modding, and to share their own stock wallpapers etc.</p>
<p>But it was just normal then, it was going like a normal 2d movie no big reactions, then after some years the era of android has been started where android used to release third own baked software and releases the opeb source required to develop for other phone manufactures and developers.</p>
<p>I still remembered, 10years back when I used to explore and got into XDA thing, it was absolutely not understandable at the time it looks something techy and cool but used to play games after looking for sometime it was boring me up😂</p>
<p>There after I got to understand custom ROMs and some research regarding thanks to the pro geek websites at the time, OK keeping the memories aside custom ROMs after 2008 are going fine developers like removing some features to make ROM less size and adding some mods to speed up the device, added some battery ui tweaks etc. But there was no major update a complete ROM.</p>
<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cxtcQrknf4g/XgoCI3WX0zI/AAAAAAAAAVM/HV2uXDCfqIY7Uw8IfS0t0d10BAmk71-vwCEwYBhgL/s1600/IMG_20191230_192432_036.jpg" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" height="212" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2_history-of-custom-roms.webp" width="320" alt="2_history-of-custom-roms"></a></p>
<p>Then cyanogenmod entered into custom ROMs section, it was a fork of android open source project, the first initial release was 3.1 (Dream &#038; Magic) on 1st July 2009, this become huge hit at the time, the major reason is that android was failed to give updates to thier devices as more and more manufactures continue to use aosp update thing was in hands of manufactures not in google manufactures are lacking at giving updates, google only able to give to thier own devices..,</p>
<p>When there is no freedom of adding some amazing features that are needed, that was easily can be added even people really wanted it from google, then for everything that suits your need is cyanogemod name itselfs says the ROM primary thing is to provide as much freedom as possible to user to do more than normal. It has its own theming, it has large development community and its was considered to be the starting point of custom developers.</p>
<p>Cyanogenmod got such amazing popularity that the users that installed this os was around 50million, not only that cyanogenmod has a contract with micromax to release the device with thier software pre-intalled, in micromqx Yu series the major reason to buy a Yu device is to experience cyanogenmod os in it for buyers and it worked very well for micromax.</p>
<p>Cyanogenmod really amazed not only the normal users but developers to.. As it is considered the starting point for devs. Later many developers compiled the source and used cyanogenmod resources to release for thier own devices, many developers developed and contributed many things for cyanogenmod growth.</p>
<p>Cyanogenmod was continuing at a good speed, and everyone using it, cyanogenmod want to switch thier version and name to something else and thier last release with cyanogenmod was in 2016 with android : version &#8211; marshmallow 6.0 </p>
<p>Later in 2017 they got Changed thier brand name to lineage os and continuing with same name and thier logo with showing the all the developers names in it in a unique way.</p>
<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tNYH6u2kVjA/XgoB9cl1b1I/AAAAAAAAAVI/_WkaVI0vc1gJQIOLDoy0kjsLiqPCdC5EQCEwYBhgL/s1600/IMG_20191230_192451_435.jpg" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" height="319" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/3_history-of-custom-roms.webp" width="320" alt="3_history-of-custom-roms"></a></p>
<p>However, lineage is still used for most of the customs ROMs as base, still lineage was the first to get aosp versioned latest os in weeks later other customs will get thier own compiled version, </p>
<p>Likely, Lineage has become a aosp version of stock android build by lineage.. It was so close to aosp</p>
<p>When this is going on, there are several developers who taken lineage and cyanogenmod base to create thier own rom adding and cherry picking own features and releasing ROMs with thier name has been started and its still going on.</p>
<p>Being lineage is was the main priority for developers to take as base due to lack of advancement and contribution, later years the developers has started making thier own source for to build based on aosp..</p>
<p>Now a days, devs using aosp as base, as the contribution and development has become more and more in recent years after nought 7.0 release.</p>
<p>When lineage os still considered as first try ROM to every beginner, and it is considered as classic ROM for every geek.</p>
<p>Later, Android released thier own customized version of thier software like android go for low spec devices and it got adapted by custom ROM developers to use for thier own devices.</p>
<p>Then android got to understood the problem of updates later they introduced treble, this also a big advancement to release and get latest softwares on hands like nexus or pixels, likely it was a big hot topic around custom ROM community it got well utilised by developers,</p>
<p>Some manufactures released 32bit software for devices but android software architecture for latest advancements like google camera require 64 bit, it was impossible for developers to build 64bit software for a 32bit software released phone due to lack of drivers,</p>
<p>Later after alot of  hardwork, developer named Vache achieved this feat of running 64bit software and it become a spot light for other devices, thanks to him if he didn&#8217;t done it then it may be under not possible for years&#8230;</p>
<p>Later treble twrp has been released, between team win recovery project is a touch based recovery got in the time of lollipop, before that cwm recovery to in install ROMs which do require physical access to control through volume button and power button to install ROMs,</p>
<p>Treble is just required gsi &#8211; generic system image and a treble compatible device to install latest android software and some devices somehow made compatible by developers even thought the compatibility has not listed by google.</p>
<p>Later developers started working on treble and made thier own treble compatible twrps to install treble based ROMs , and modified vendors to boot the os not only that with some fixes etc, some developers worked really hard to bring this latest version gsi with many hacks and tricks, developer named erfan was very active in this section and development for gsi still going on with this own gsi porting tool which helped many custom rom developers and users.</p>
<p>However, treble do have it&#8217;s own partition requirements for specific devices, some devices only support a partition and some ab partition and some a64 only, users have to choose thier comparable version of gsi else the device can be hard brick and not usable..,</p>
<p>Now, the era of gsi has been started like we had in cyanogenmod the continuous developements going on, a new gsi popup everyday either ported or normal there are two gsi here to one was stock one which was phh treble developer phhuson which focus on stock.. Another erfan which port gsi from device specific OEM software one plus, xiaomi etc and make it available to other gsi compatible devices.</p>
<p>This is it, let&#8217;s hope for more amazing things&#8230;</p>
<p>Conclusion : Roms are not enough, custom ROMs are needed to full fill, got bored with android os something new needed, suddenly cyanogenmod appeared got huge attention and got popularised like anyone it has become starting point for developers, later it got adapted and taken as base, still lack of updates going on the new gsi thing got into attention and popularized like cyanogenmod it was fulfilling the requirements same as cm, for all these things XDA is main portal for it.</p>
