<p>1.1 petit flour to 14.0 Upside Down Cake, Android a mobile operating system made for smartphones came a long way, in the initial version Android doesn&#8217;t have any codename but later on as the creator of Android &#8220;Andy Rubins love deserts each new version of Android has named with desert names classified as codenames, since the inception starting from alpha 1.0 version Android in the process of updating and upgrading to next level over the years has gone through a lot of developments by fixing loopholes aka bugs and by adapting to latest trends and technologies needed and wanted by userbase around the world accordingly, thanks to that as time goes in just few years Android became powerful and advanced modern operating system used by majority of people worldwide, isn&#8217;t that quite fantastic? but the problem here is if you own an old Android device then due to it&#8217;s outdated hardware and software technologies, latest Android versions may be incompatible and won&#8217;t work well, that can be concerning to certain percentage of people as for whatever reasons many people still use old Android devices, mainy because they can&#8217;t afford new ones, or even if they can afford still wanna use old Android device or it&#8217;s software versions for nostalgia reasons, are you one of them?</p>
<p>If yes then as said earlier old Android devices comes with outdated hardware and software technologies which means they can be incompatible and won&#8217;t be able to install latest versions of Android thus you&#8217;ll get limited options and features that may cause un-fulfilling overall user experience, yet you may accept and ok with it and no matter what you still wanna use old Android devices, isn&#8217;t it? But there are many developers who are not ready for it they won&#8217;t work and support outdated old Android devices, because old Android devices usually lack large userbase and latest technologies, so adding support for them definitely requires extra load on back with lack of enough returns, which is why many developers eventually stop support for old Android devices, while some right from the start solely focus on providing support for latest Android devices and software versions, so at the end if you&#8217;re someone who own old Android device or software versions then now or in future you are the one who going to suffer as the latest softwares from stock OEM or third party developers are what keeps you stay connected and updated, not having them can push you back in this tech world.</p>

<p>Google, as you may know a well known search engine from Alphabet inc. own many revolutionary and amazing digital products as shown above, it&#8217;s not just them there are many more and the list goes on, though out of them almost all digital products have huge userbase and successful yet to reduce back load and due to various different strategies and reasons already discontinued and ended support for some of them permanently and may going to do the same for more in future on all or old Android devices and software versions, while some digital products are only made and exclusive for new ones, so basically at the end when Google being such a large scale company with huge capacity and resources struggle, fail and decide to discontinue and end further support to old Android devices and software versions, how can a small single individual or team of developers were able to maintain and continue product support forever, it&#8217;s not a simple cake walk right? So expecting and demanding support can sometimes bit outrageous for sure yet still a lot of people out of necessity keep on demanding or requesting developers to provide support for old Android devices and software versions, isn&#8217;t that right?</p>
<p>YouTube, as per context let us now focus on it, you may know YouTube is world&#8217;s popular leading social video blogging platform currently owned and developed by Google, it is in existence for more than a decade, back in the beginning days of YouTube, it used to have pretty basic limited options and features but as time goes as per research and development which include demands, requests, needs and requirements of people including that to meet latest standards and adapt to new technologies, Google not just added but also removed many interesting and useful options and features thanks to that we got to see robust feature rich modern YouTube for cross platforms, but the problem here is Google for whatever reasons won&#8217;t let latest Android versions use old YouTube app versions and old Android versions use latest YouTube app versions, while there are certain old YouTube app versions, they won&#8217;t work on old or new Android versions which can be issue as certain percentage of people for whatever reasons mainly to get old layout or options and features like and want to use old YouTube app versions, but as they are now unavailable on latest YouTube app versions, many people who want them usually get disappointed and try to somehow get them, though it is not possible to get them on official YouTube app but there are numerous modified and custom patched YouTube apps by using them we can not just get old layout and features on latest YouTube versions but also use discontinued old or new YouTube app versions on old Android devices.</p>
<p>Even thought, there are number of modified custom patched YouTube apps available for Android devices out of them Vanced YouTube is most popular one but eventually it was discontinued due to law suit from Google but later on inspired by Vanced, number of developers as Vanced is open source using it&#8217;s code with some additional contributions tried to bring back Vanced Project as it is liked and used by a lot of users mainy geeks, in that process we got to eventually see Project ReVanced which is considered as current successor of Vanced YouTube Project, ReVanced just like Vanced, provide many extra features and options that you won&#8217;t get on official YouTube app including that ReVanced also let you use old YouTube apps options and features, layouts etc, thanks to that many people who like and want to utilize them usually shift to ReVanced from the official YouTube app, isn&#8217;t? which is smart choice but the only drawback of original Project ReVanced app is it targets latest Android versions not the old ones, so you won&#8217;t be able to use latest versions of ReVanced on old Android devices and software versions even old versions of ReVanced eventually stop working on old Android versions just like stock official YouTube app, isn&#8217;t that bit disappointing? but wait thanks to some geeky developers who found workarounds to use the old versions of ReVanced on old Android devices and software versions like starting from lollipop 5.0 by using slightly modified custom patched ReVanced app versions made by them, you&#8217;re now able to enjoy YouTube on go, isn&#8217;t that exciting!</p>
<p>The last YouTube version available for Android 6 Marshmallow and Android 7 Nougut, is 17.34.36 but as said earlier Google eventually stop support for them, I expect they already did it, so developer Kitadai31 who at one point back then using old Android device and software versions, want to make YouTube app work on old Android 6.0 and 7.0 versions, in that process he found a workaround by forking RVX aka ReVanced Extended v2.160.1 by Initia00, as it&#8217;s the last compatible patch with YouTube version 17.34.36, and then accordingly he created some ReVanced patches to modify and spoof YouTube at the same time fix some issues, glitches and backport some features like endless buffering, to provide a stable version of ReVanced for Android 6.0 and 7.0 devices, at present his modified RVX versions is working well and was beneficial to many people, but the only drawback here is his version won&#8217;t work on Android 5.0 lollipop, if you want YouTube work on that version then Kitadai31 suggest you to use another fork of ReVanced by developer d4n3436 who spoofed YouTube 16.40.36 thanks to that now you can experience YouTube on much older Android versions, cool right?</p>
<p>You may know Android 5.0 lollipop software version is like 10 years old released back in year 2014, at present even on browser you can&#8217;t use YouTube on Android 5.0 device browser, as Google not just stopped support for app but also for webview as well, considering that getting access to YouTube app now on Android 5.0 devices in the era of Android 14 and 15 is simply marvellous thing, just think about it such a old Android version device still able to play videos on YouTube that to with latest options and features, it&#8217;s for sure a useful jackpot isn&#8217;t it? If you have a old Android device in desk or use it as a backup or secondary device for calls and messages etc, in that as an addition get to access YouTube will be amazing including that let&#8217;s say you have a spare old Android 5.0, 6.0, 7.0 version device and wanna give or gift to someone who just simply want to use calls, messages and YouTube for such person, pre-installing ReVanced YouTube will work fabulously, not just that if you limited yourself not to utilize old Android devices and softwares versions as on that there is support for YouTube but now with the help of patched ReVanced you may be able to continue using old Android device and version as a daily driver regularly.</p>
<p>Revanced Extended by d4n3436 is for YouTube version 16.40.36, by using that as said earlier now you can use YouTube on Android 5.0 lollipop devices, which is based on kitadai31&#8217;s fork of ReVanced Extended for Android 6/7, that&#8217;s for sure is exciting, but wait if you&#8217;re someone who don&#8217;t have any past usage experience with ReVanced, then hold on, if you&#8217;re a newbie to this custom patched YouTube apps then you need to know some things before you get started as mis-handling them can lead to soft or hard bricking device, foremost you can install ReVanced in non root and root mode, while root mode is way stable and you usually don&#8217;t get issues including that it doesn&#8217;t require extra microg apps to login to Google accounts, when it comes to non-root you may find incompatibility issues and it likely requires extra microg app to login into Google accounts, at the same time non root ReVanced mode don&#8217;t usually work on custom Android softwares like MIUI and HiOS etc, while root mode of ReVanced very likely gonna work on them, anyway at the end you have to install non root ReVanced YouTube like any other app but for the root version you have choice to install it as module through Magisk or in the custom recovery, so do you like it? are you ready to use YouTube on Android 5, 6, 7, devices, if yes then let&#8217;s get started.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/apatch-a-root-solution-alternative-to-magisk-and-kernelsu.webp" alt="apatch-a-root-solution-alternative-to-magisk-and-kernelsu" width="400" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve checked number of rooting softwares so far, a decade back we used to have plenty of rooting softwares to root Android devices basically smartphones, like Kingo root, Frama root, Super SU etc, as back in time a decade ago it&#8217;s the beginning era of modern smartphones, at that time they used to have new early access hardware and software, which are emerging ones with astounding capabilities at the same time considering available technologies at that time they are powerful, advanced and revolutionary as well, but as they are in early access they used to have a lot of bugs and security is not up to the mark in comparison to today&#8217;s standards, due to that developers were able to simply find and exploit loop holes in hardware and mainly in software to modify parameters of them for various different purposes, but as time goes makers of them tightened and strengthened security of hardware and software of smartphones using a lot of technologies due to that now it became pretty hard and difficult to find loopholes and exploit them even in order to do that in present time requires unlocking of device bootloader compulsorily, in sense it&#8217;s not easy as before, you must need external PC or device and has to be done carefully.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.techtracker.in/2022/04/why-you-should-root-your-android.html" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">+ Why you should root your Android smartphone?</a></p>
<p>Now a days, mobile makers by default powering up their smartphones with modern feature rich operating systems like HiOS, HyperOS, ColorOS, MIUI etc and software applications with such advanced features and options that a decade back we used to only get them when we root device for sure, including that to make things much easier now we also got to find no root methods to customize and modify operating system by getting access through android debug bridge aka adb commands and apps like Shizuku, though no root ways are not as powerful as root but they are pretty much enough for a lot of people to do more than a non root mode device, but thing is if you don&#8217;t have stock feature rich operating system, and don&#8217;t wanna root &amp; engage in non root adb command based methods yet still we can get root level customizations through custom roms, which are developed by third party developers, in order to flash custom roms you need to have compatible device with unlocked bootloader after that with right guidelines you&#8217;ll be able to flash any compatible custom roms through adb or using custom recovery like TWRP, at the end all this procedure seems complicated for newbies but once done quite worthy.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.techtracker.in/2022/03/hios-vs-miui-which-is-best-custom.html" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">+ HiOS vs MIUI, which is best custom Android OS on smartphones?</a></p>
<p>Even though, at present time we have many custom roms and no root methods which provide root level features and options on non rooted smartphones but at the end they may be not enough for some people especially geeks, due to various different reasons mainly because though some stock firmwares, third party custom roms and adb based methods may provide number of amazing features and options but still rooting provide full authority and way better different level experience, like basically with root you will get complete control of your smartphone as you can do almost anything on software and hardware from modifying system files, customizing graphical user interface, over-cloaking or under-cloaking CPU and GPU etc, what not you can unlock, remove any OEM based restrictions and limitations to gain access to everything which is not possible in non root mode, that&#8217;s why rooted smartphone with it&#8217;s plenty of benefits usually always have way better edge over non root ones but it all comes at the cost of some cons like as rooting can do anything in system level, modifying incorrectly can make the device unusable or irreparable including that it also voids statutory device warranty unless you live in EU aka european union.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.techtracker.in/2022/04/why-you-shouldnt-root-your-android.html" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">+ Why you shouldn&#8217;t root your Android smartphone?</a></p>
<p>There are number of rooting softwares based on operating systems available on smartphones, Android and iOS are most popular and widely used top operating systems for smartphones, though we can get system level access on both operating systems but on iOS rooting is known as jailbreak, if you&#8217;re someone who owns iPhone then you may be familiar with jailbreaking iOS, anyhow both operating systems are from different makers and developed using different technologies, while Android is free and open source released and maintained by Google and iOS is a closed source by Apple inc. due to that we can&#8217;t utilize same methods and software applications to get root access on them, but thing if the convenience of rooting smartphone is your top priority then it&#8217;s better go with Android it&#8217;s FOSS, so source code is publicly available online in form of AOSP, that makes things easier to find bugs and rooting Android powered smartphones, but when it comes to iOS powered iPhones as they&#8217;re closed source software and hardware wise, it&#8217;s not just difficult but also hard to jailbreak iOS, yet still thanks to skilled developers out there who somehow were able to find methods to jailbreak every latest version of iOS, at the end based on your needs and factors it&#8217;s up to you to choose Android or iOS.</p>
<p>If you choose to have Android, then you&#8217;re at right place, as said earlier back in time in the beginning era of smartphones and mobile operating systems, rooting Android smartphones used to be pretty simple, at that time there are many capable apps for mobiles and softwares for PCs, they used to root most Android smartphones in one click without unlocking bootloader that to in just few minutes thanks to that a lot of users almost all the time with just mobile app itself were able to easily root Android, though we do have desktop apps as well but they are less likely and rarely used by majority of Android users, whoever don&#8217;t have PC and want more comfort at the same time don&#8217;t want to put extra work in setting up and connecting Android with PC using proper USB cable and drivers, used to always prefer mobile root apps, anyway at the end though one click root apps are convenient but thing is most of them are closed source and the methods they used to root Android versions are not public due to that they are not trustworthy including that rooting softwares get direct system level write access which means any mess up in process or aftermath of rooting may soft or hard brick device which may only get fixed or recovered when you re-flash stock firmware, isn&#8217;t that risky? Anyway as time goes in latest versions of Android OS security level increased immensely, due to that most one click rooting softwares have stopped support at the same time popular rooting software SuperSu got discontinued back in year 2016, so many Android users wanted new way better alternative rooting software, at that time we got systemless Android root software named Magisk.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.techtracker.in/2022/09/what-happened-to-chainfire-supersu.html" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">+ What happened to Chainfire SuperSu?</a></p>
<p>Magisk is revolutionary systemless Android rooting software developed by topjohnwu, thanks to it&#8217;s systemless root method it got huge popularity and most Android users eventually shifted to Magisk and it became best alternative to Chainfire SuperSu, at present time Magisk is still on go choice for majority of Android users, unlike old one click root and SuperSU root based methods they used to enable direct system root access, that as said earlier is risky thing, while Magisk is systemless which means though it does get you root system level write access but it&#8217;s achieved by patching firmware boot image after that Magisk create a overlay under your root partition and link it, due to that whatever root data will be in overlay, because of that when thing mess up and goes wrong, you don&#8217;t have to hard reset device instead you just uninstall Magisk or it&#8217;s modules via recovery or restore your stock firmware boot image, which in most cases will unbrick or solve issues of your Android device, that&#8217;s why Magisk is considered as way better safe rooting software but like most softwares it has downsides as well, the main issue with Magisk is you must unlock device bootloader, and it patches stock firmware boot image including that it will also alter system root partition by storing Magisk data that arises SafetyNet issue, basically it makes your Android device fail in Google&#8217;s basic integrity and CTS aka compatibility test suite profile match thus your Android device will be acknowledged as quite unsecure and untrustworthy due to that you can&#8217;t run some secure apps, which can be fixed using modules like play integrity, playcurl, MagiskHideProps, SafetyNet etc but it&#8217;s temporary fix including that Magisk is also not quite reliable in hiding root from device and apps, though there are few ways like MagiskHide, DenyList, Shamiko etc to fix, they do work but not accurately which is why many Android users wanted better and reliable alternative to Magisk, as there is demand to supply lately we got to see kernel based Android root softwares.</p>

<p>Kernel, is most important thing on smartphones, it&#8217;s basically in simple words connect and work as bridge between your device hardware and software, without kernel you can&#8217;t make things works on device, in sense kernel is quite sensitive thing that has to be handled with care else it may hard brick your device, which is why many developers suggest not to touch and play around with kernel and even if you do make sure to always backup device kernel, so that there will be chances of recovering bricked device, though messing up with kernel is like playing with fire, yet still for the improvement of device, many geeky developers explore kernel, tweaks kernel and also patch and make custom kernels, mainly to upgrade or update operating system, improve performance, battery life and better compatibility with hardware and software etc, isn&#8217;t that amazing? in recent years as said earlier kernel based Android solutions came up in this tech world, out of them the one I can recall is KernelSU, which basically patches Kernel to achieve root access on Android device because of that root won&#8217;t be detected by device or apps and it will also pass basic integrity and CTS profile match. due to that you&#8217;ll get better privacy, security and anonymity, which is why KernelSU considered as way better and more reliable rooting software than Magisk including that KernelSU also provide modules support thanks to that day by day KernelSU userbase growing immensely and it&#8217;s widely considered as the best alternative to Magisk, but thing is though KernelSU is something that we can definitely rely upon yet still some people for whatever reasons want and search for way better alternative to KernelSU.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.techtracker.in/2023/05/kernelsu-kernel-based-android-root.html" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">+ KernelSU &#8211; A kernel based Android root alternative to Magisk.</a></p>
<p>Recently, after the success of KernelSU, many developers making their own kernel based root softwares for Android devices, out of them the one that picking up and became one of the best alternative to KernelSU is an free and open source software named APatch that uses Kernel Patch as core and KernelSU for magisk module like support and app UI aka user interface, at present APatch only support ARM64 with Android kernel Version 3.18 &#8211; 6.1 devices, but we may in future also get support for ARM7 and X86 devices as well with other Kernel versions, including that team also planned support for Samsung devices, at the end APatch is basically a modified version of KernelSU so if you&#8217;re someone who right on don&#8217;t want to use KernelSU can go for APatch, including that there is APatch Lite developed by APatch developer Ponces, APatch Lite basically has Hardcoded superkey for simplicity with simplified UI dashboard and No KPM management, which didn&#8217;t exist in orginal version of APatch, but thing is as superkey is hardcoded in APatch Lite it is not secure thus you have to use it quite carefully, so do you like it?

					<description><![CDATA[Who doesn&#8217;t want to save space and network data on smartphones and [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/how-to-encode-videos-to-hevc-x265-format-using-google-colab.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/how-to-encode-videos-to-hevc-x265-format-using-google-colab.webp" alt="how-to-encode-videos-to-hevc-x265-format-using-google-colab" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>Who doesn&#8217;t want to save space and network data on smartphones and PCs, usually a lot of people do isn&#8217;t it? Unless they have big storage and data plan right? Majority of people especially in developing countries like india, bhutan, singapore and brazil etc, most likely not just buy low end mobiles and PCs which have limited space but also connect to limited network data plans with validity of one or few months, are you one of them? If so then you may probably download low quality data size and compressed files to save network data and regularly time to time delete old files to save storage on device right?</p>
<p>It is bit hard and time taking process for sure isn&#8217;t it? As though there are apps in PCs and smartphones which are able to automatically delete unused small and large files, but at the end sometimes you have to manually verify and delete them, so that important required files will not be lost as if they lost sometimes recovering them is bit difficult and even impossible isn&#8217;t it? that makes sense we must always be careful when dealing with such stuff, but thing is sometimes you may don&#8217;t want to delete any existing files at all yet still you may have to delete them forefully to free up device space for new files.</p>
<p>Generally, majority of people who have limited device storage space delete old files for new ones, thought we can use cloud hosting or streaming apps, but for that you need fast high data cap limit or unlimited data network, if you don&#8217;t have them then it may be not possible for you to upload or stream most large size stuff online so in-order to save device storage you may like a lot of people around the world have to download or stream low quality files or compressed files and archives right? It will for sure definitely save device space and network data.</p>
<p>But, thing is not all files will be compressed and provided online even if you found required compressed files or achives online or offline, when you uncompress them they&#8217;ll revert back to original size, so to store and manage them you need sufficient device space, it&#8217;s possible you may think that if i have high data cap network then I can simply download large files and compress them to save space for new ones but thing is compression of files require high end PC or smartphone so only when you have them it&#8217;ll work flawlessly, else you have to compromise and use low quality and less data size files which will work but may not give full-fledged usage or experience.</p>
<p>Even though, there are large percentage of people who don&#8217;t care much about quality of files when they are less in size but sometimes it is important and necessary to have full quality and size files else it can be issue and bit disappointing as well isn&#8217;t it? There are a lot of people who care and want to have high quality full sizes files either it&#8217;s videos, documents, images etc, are you one of them? If so are you unable to download and use high quality full sizes files due to limited device storage and network data? but still somehow want to download and use high quality full size files? then you&#8217;re now at right place.</p>
<p>We are now going to say you how you can download and store high quality full size files even with limited storage space devices and data cap networks, As you may know each file is available in different formats like for instance when it comes to images, you&#8217;ll find top formats, like png, jpeg, gif, tiff etc, so in the case of images when you make a high quality image in .png format it&#8217;s size will be high but when you convert .png format image to .webp image format you&#8217;ll have same image quality but with drastic reduction in file size thanks to it&#8217;s lossy compression algorithm technology, so at the end even if you choose .webp over .png still visibility will be same and in addition you&#8217;ll save device storage and data on the go.</p>
<p>In sense, there are certain file formats similar to .webp, with them you&#8217;ll get full quality data but at quite less size thanks to their algorithm technologies, since past few decades people around the world got used to digital file formats out of them digital images and videos are most used ones, in this context of article if we look into videos, there are many different video container formats like .mp4, .3gp, .mkv etc, each video container format has it&#8217;s own pros and cons mainly they differ in size as well due to underlying algorithm technologies, isn&#8217;t that fascinating?</p>
<p>In this digital era, thought we have different video container formats but if you care about video size then what matters most is how it is coded, since long time most videos are encoded in h.264 basically AVC aka advanced video coding format a quite popular video compression codec primarily used for bluray discs, but since past few decades it is being used in almost all video container formats, h.264 codec basically lowers the bitrate of video without reducing its quality, thought h.264 provide pretty good video compression but if you&#8217;re tight on device storage space and data network then h.264 encoded videos may feel like large file size ones for sure.</p>
<p>Do you know about h.264/AVC videos, have you used them? You may probably unknowingly got in touch with them as web is highly filled with them, if you&#8217;re satisfied with it&#8217;s video file size then it&#8217;s fine but if you don&#8217;t then you may probably already looking for an alternative right? If so then there is hevc aka high efficiency video coding h.265 codec that&#8217;s basically replacement and evolution of h.264 with like 50% more video compression rate so that you&#8217;ll get video files in half size with no reduction in visual quality due to that you can download even with limited data cap network and store them on quite low storage space devices, fabulous right?</p>
<p>However, thought videos despite their container formats when encoded with hevc h.265 video codec, you&#8217;ll find 50% reduction in size but the problem here is not all videos are available in .h265 codec and uploaded on web, so at the end if you want certain video with hevc .x265 codec then you have to encode it yourself using certain softwares like ffmpeg, but thing is encoding use a lot of RAM, so if you don&#8217;t have high end PC or smartphone then it may take long time to encode and convert even small videos to hevc h.265, isn&#8217;t that bit disappointing, It can be but don&#8217;t worry recently we got to know about a simple method by using that you can encode any size video file to hevc .h265, excited?</p>
<p>Colab, have you ever heard of this? It&#8217;s basically a platform provided by Google, Colab is a hosted Jupyter Notebook service that requires no setup to use and provides free access to computing resources, including GPUs and TPUs, thanks to that some developers provided a Google Colab notebook script that you can use for free to encode videos uploaded on Google Drive to hevc .265, but wait are you thinking all this upload and convert stuff consume network data? don&#8217;t worry Google Colab use it&#8217;s cloud servers to encode videos including that we will be using telegram bot to upload our videos to Drive, so you only use network data when you want to download encoded videos on device from drive, so do you like it? are you interested? If yes then let&#8217;s explore more.</p>
<p><strong>• How to encode videos to hevc .265 codec using Google Colab •</strong></p>

<p>Blogging, that&#8217;s not an easy job isn&#8217;t it? If you&#8217;re blogger then you probably know how exactly it feels to take up blogging right? If you&#8217;re passionate about it then for sure, it will be exciting but at the same the more and more blogging you do, the higher you have to dig into subject to present  information accordingly to meet upto your quality standards and targets as much as possible, it will be challenging task that&#8217;s what makes it enjoyable and yeah for sure it&#8217;ll let you learn and pratice various skills like for instance content writing, proof reader, presentation, writing skills and many more on the go, which are useful in any era as since ancient times we&#8217;ve been using written communication and in future will use it as well as it&#8217;s quite necessary so the better you present the more amazing it will be isn&#8217;t it? We bloggers spend a lot of time like hours even days and months to write and present information in a way to reach our and viewer expectations thought there will many hurdles in doing it but yeah it has to done right? the more time, focus, concentration, skill and hard work we put in to accomplish writing content, the more experienced and skilled will become to be considered as professional Bloggers.</p>
<p>Do you know? Who exactly is Blogger, if you&#8217;re new to this stuff then for you in simple Blogger is basically modern word used for person who does blogging on internet site linked with certain Web2 or Web3 address like for ex : yoursite.com, while blogging is basically making and publishing text written digital content on internet, is it clear? I hope so anyway a blogger can take up multiple roles cause as said earlier blogging teachs you many skills on the flow mainly speeding up the typing, entrepreneurship, management, etc same as like running own newspaper but blogging is less cost, more flexibility and fast reach to people around the world, so a blogger can be said as journalist as well at the end both are similar like in Newspaper even if we write good content and don&#8217;t manage and maintain well, it will start to decline and eventually downfall likewise in blogging as well even if you write pretty good content still if you manage other factors of site badly like user interface and user experience etc then blog will start to decline and eventually downfall which is why optimization of not just content but also blogging site is necessary to lead up in ranks and attract visitors globally.</p>
<p>Ranking is everywhere right? We can rank almost anything in blogging like content, quality, writing, user interface and user experience of blog, what not you can rate almost everything, the better ranking your blog has the better and more chances it has to rank on search engines like Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo etc, in sense basically search engine optimisation inshort SEO is important for growth of blog which is why a lot of bloggers try their best and keep on improving seo to get high score so that the blog and it&#8217;s articles will rank on top of the search engines which will not just increase organic traffic of blog but also give benefit in many ways like in improving brand value and domain authority etc, that&#8217;s why a lot of bloggers use many methods to increase seo though there is both good &#038; bad ones, at the end good methods are better and it will keep blog in safe zone, there are many ways to improve seo out of them speed of blog the higher it is the more you&#8217;ll get seo as people tends to view blogs which have less loading times, fast and responsive so if you are newbie blogger make sure your blog load everything in below 5 seconds to stay up in the charts of seo, gotcha?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t wanna bore you off with details how internet and world wide web works and came into existence that&#8217;s another story for that you can read our related articles, here in this context will be focusing on evolution of blogs, at first in early era of world wide web almost all people used to make and publish content on static site blogs developed primarily using high level programming language HTML &#8211; hypertext markup language by hosting and serving blog contents from computer, as HTML is less resources blog used to be small thus it used to load pretty fast on world wide web browsers, but as time goes in order to evolve a lot of people started using CSS &#8211; cascading styling sheets, Javascript, PHP and some other programming languages to make and improve structure of blogs, but the problem here is they add up some more resources and external load on blog, they will reduce blog load time thought optimization like minify and compression of blog code used to improve load times but thing is at the end making, managing, and running blog from own computer used to be bit hard and difficult task for sure.</p>
<p>Especially, if you&#8217;re newbie and not web developer setting up static site and manually building and hosting them on your personal computer and serving them on web can be challenging task, it not just takes a lot of time but also can be quite expensive when you&#8217;re site has large scale traffic, which is why a lot of people back in time wanted simple and better method to create blog and publish content on web, as there is such huge demand and usage of internet rising rapidly around the world, many companies to supply tried to build digital software portals to simplify all this, in that process we got revolutionary cms aka content management platforms which are easy to utilize with them you can easily create dynamic blog sites and publish content on web in few minutes as most cms platforms offer not just cloud server hosting for blog but also provide all in one tools with simple intuitive user interface and experience to manage blog on the go thanks to that large percentage of people shifted and started using cms platforms that led to evolution of Web 1.0 to 2.0.</p>
<p>Yes, indeed emerging technologies will evolve web like concept of crypto currency and decentralisation etc directly and indirectly played role in evolution of internet to decentralised web 3.0, but at present internet is mostly web 2.0 where we use centralized cms platforms, thought there are many free and paid cms platforms but out of them Blogger by Google and WordPress by Automatic inc. are free and popular ones used by millions of users worldwide, are you one of them? If you&#8217;re then you may probably know  Blogger and WordPress use number of server-side programming languages, databases, scripts, software components etc in front and backend to publicize your blog and it&#8217;s content on web, thought if you take good care in optimizing your blog site making it less size and resources then it will be fast but in any case dynamic server side blog site and content has more resources so they usually take more time to load than static ones which is why a lot of people who want the blog to load faster instead make and use static site blogs.</p>
<p>However, as said earlier unless you&#8217;re developer it&#8217;s hard to maintain static blog sites atleast you need to have geeky level smartness to cope up and run static blog sites which if you have already then all is well, but if you don&#8217;t then cms platforms like Blogger or WordPress are way better choice, but incase you for whatever reason can&#8217;t, unable or don&#8217;t want to use cms platforms anymore instead want much better and simple way to build and use static blog sites then we have static site generators though in early days of web we don&#8217;t have them but as time goes people want simple and fast way to build static sites as there is demand to supply number of developers made and released amazing static site generators like Hugo and Jekyll etc which you can install and run on your server to build and serve static sites in few minutes, so do you wanna use them? If you do then in order to do that first you have to import and convert blog articles from Blogger or WordPress to compatible meta format of static site generators.</p>
<p>Even though, at present there are many static site generators but in this context will be discussing about Hugo an free and open source static site generator written using programming language Go created by Steve Francia back in year 2013 after that it&#8217;s development is continued by Bjørn Erik Pedersen with few other contributors, thought at the end as said earlier generally all static sites are fast but when it comes to build time Hugo is promoted and better known for blazing fast site build times then most static site generators, so if you have big site with a lot of articles then Hugo may have slight better edge in comparison to bit slow build time static site generators like Jekyll, anyhow it depends on various factors and mainly it&#8217;s user specific, kindly choose the one which works for you, if you choose to use Hugo then you&#8217;re at right place, now we are going to show you how you can migrate from Blogger or WordPress to Hugo with GitHub Pages, so do you like it? are you interested in Hugo, If yes then let&#8217;s explore more.</p>

<p>Well, now let&#8217;s move on to setting up Hugo site using Ubuntu.</p>
<p><strong>• How to setup Github and build Hugo site using Ubuntu • </strong></p>
<p><i>~ Enter and execute below commands ~</i></p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>sudo apt install gh</strong></p>
<p><strong>&#8211; sudo gh auth login</strong> ( now use available options to login into your Github account )</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>hugo new site &#8220;</strong> yoursitename <strong>&#8220;</strong></p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>cd &#8220;</strong> your site name <strong>&#8220;</strong></p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>git init</strong> ( this adds empty repository and set branch always to master )</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>git submodule add</strong> ( theme url ) <strong> themes/</strong> ( theme name ) | replace with your ones |</p>
<p>&#8211; ( In above command just change theme url and theme name ) </p>
<p><i>~ Now you have to add Hugo theme of your choice ( I&#8217;m using Blist ) ~</i></p>
<p>&#8211; Get hugo themes from <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">themes.gohugo.io</a> or from <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoThemes" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">GitHub repository</a> etc.</p>
<p>Note : each hugo theme has it&#8217;s own guide, make sure to check it from official sources before you dive into this stuff for instance Blist theme setup will go like below and it may work for many other hugo themes.</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>cd themes</strong></p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>cd blist-hugo-theme</strong> ( your theme name )</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>ls</strong></p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>cp package.json package-lock.json ~/blank</strong> ( add your hugo site name root directory )</p>
<p>&#8211; Now go back to root directory of your hugo site using command : <strong>cd ..</strong> twice.</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>echo &#8216;theme = &#8220;blist-hugo-theme&#8221;&#8216; &gt;&gt; config.yml</strong> ( it will set theme to blist, you can replace with your theme name )</p>
<p>&#8211; I&#8217;m using config.toml for this theme, but you may use hugo.toml as well, it changes syntax of code, so keep that in mind.</p>
<p>&#8211; Once we set theme in config.yml, you can add extra code which you can get from the hugo theme Github public repository.</p>

<p>&#8211; In config.toml ( don&#8217;t forget to change <strong>baseURL</strong> to your GitHub respository, it&#8217;s important else your blog and imported articles will not work for sure. ) </p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>git config user.email</strong> ( GitHub email )</p>

<p>&#8211; <strong>npm i -g postcss-cli</strong></p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>su</strong> ( enter root mode on Ubuntu if npm install &#038; postcss got some errors ) </p>
<p>&#8211; it asks you to enter root password, if you didn&#8217;t already set any root password, set it by using command : <strong>sudo passwd root</strong> ) </p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>npm install</strong> ( Again )</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>npm i -g postcss-cli</strong> ( Again )</p>

<p>&#8211; <strong>cp ~/folder/* ~/sitename/content/</strong>  ( replace folder with your folder name in root directory, where you imported your articles and then your hugo site name ) </p>
<p>&#8211; you can also create sub folder in content directory using <strong>mkdir &#8221; sub-folder &#8220;</strong> and import your articles over there as well.</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>cd  ..</strong> ( go to hugo site root directory )</p>

<p>&#8211; Now, wait for a minute and go to your GitHub pages site, it should mostly work if it didn&#8217;t check GitHub Actions for any type of errors and then fix them by getting support from Hugo Forums or support groups.</p>
<p>Bingo, you successfully created a Hugo site using Ubuntu and GitHub pages.</p>
<p>Atlast, this are just highlighted features of Hugo and GitHub pages, there may be many hidden features in-build that provides you external benefits to give the ultimate usage experience, anyway this is how you can migrate from Blogger to Hugo hosting on GitHub pages. </p>
<p>Overall, Hugo comes with many super cool themes, it may be user friendly setup and code synax that may works for web developers and geeks, that ensures quite productive experience, but in any project there is always space for improvement so let&#8217;s wait and see will Hugo get any major UI changes in future to make it even more better, as of now Hugo is nice.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is definitely worth to mention Hugo is one of the very few static page generators out there on world wide web of internet, which promote itself for blazing fast page build times better than most other static site generators, yes indeed if you&#8217;re searching for such static page generator then Hugo is worthy choice.</p>
<p>Finally, this is how you can migrate from Blogger or WordPress by hosting Hugo on GitHub pages, Hugo a free and open source static site generator, are you an existing user of Hugo? If yes do say your experience and mention why you like it in our comment section below, see ya </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/kernelsu-a-kernel-based-android-root-alternative-to-magisk.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/kernelsu-a-kernel-based-android-root-alternative-to-magisk.webp" alt="kernelsu-a-kernel-based-android-root-alternative-to-magisk" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>HTC Dream G1 is the world&#8217;s first handheld smartphone powered by top search giant Google&#8217;s free and open source mobile operating system &#8220;Android&#8221; developed and released by top search engine giant Google back in year 2008 in partnership with well known Taiwanese mobile maker HTC corporation though Google over past decade to progress and evolve done a lot of developments by adapting to latest technologies on Androd with updates and upgrades to improve as well as advance it further to next level but it is actually founded by Andy Rubens back in year 2003 which was later acquired by Google for $50 million dollors in year 2005 at that time it&#8217;s quite big investment that eventually turned out fruitful as Android is revolutionary and worked well to compete with Apple inc&#8217;s mobile operating system iOS powered iPhone series smartphones and number of other operating system powered devices around the world.</p>
<p>The early first versions of Android 1.0 and it&#8217;s update Android 1.1 doesn&#8217;t have any public codenames though some pre-1.0 milestone builds are internally tagged as Astro Boy and Blender but eventually starting from 2.0 Eclair Google started naming each new upgrade of Android with desert names known as code names like Android 3.0 as Honey Comb and Android 4.0 as icecream sandwich and so on with super cool useful new features and bug fixes on new updates and upgrades thanks to that a lot of people like and prefer to get and use Android including that back then Android seems have potential and worthy competitor to Apple inc&#8217;s closed source operating system &#8220;iOS&#8221; which is why many mobile makers around the world whoever unable to use iOS or make an alternative mobile operating system in time started using Android building their own custom versions utilizing the Android open source project aka AOSP to powerup their devices and make business with them globally.</p>
<p>Android is free and open source mobile operating system thanks to that most makers were able make and provide smartphones at less price due to that we got to see feature rich less expensive Android powered smartphones where is iOS powered iPhones are quite expensive which is why majority of people around the world like and prefer Android devices over iOS ones because of that eventually as time goes Android got huge userbase and now has more than 70% marketshare worldwide but thing is though Android is open ecosystem and by default it&#8217;s more customizable than closed ecosystem &#8220;iOS&#8221; yet still back in beginning Android used to be basic due to that users won&#8217;t be able to do much stuff so back then certain users whoever want to somehow get more out of Android started looking for ways at that time as Android is free and open source some developers found methods to root many Android smartphones to customize system well but rooting Android devices voids warrenty unless you live in EU.</p>
<p>In computers you will get open access to system partition and by simply installing or running certain install softwares as super administrator you can do things at core level and customize it extremely and extensively but where is incase of Android powered smartphones though you will get read access to system partition but write access is restricted for device security and privacy to keep you in safe zone which is pretty good but limits many capabilities and capacity of Android smartphones isn&#8217;t that bit disappointing? which is why many people want to break all the limitations of Android to utilize most functionalities of devices efficiently and effectively so for them as there is demand to supply many third party developers around the world created many amazing rooting methods and softwares like to name few kingoroot, framaroot etc to root number of Android devices in 1 click with or without PC but thing is though they does work and do job well yet still many users want better and more reliable alternative rooting software at that time we got Chainfire&#8217;s SuperSu.</p>
<p>There are many rooting softwares out of them Kingoroot is top and most popular one which worked well as by using it&#8217;s app itself users were able to root most Android smartphones in one click within 5 to 10 minutes of time but thing is as time goes Google to progress and evolve done alot of developments on Android with updates and upgrades to improve and advance it to further next level in that process they fixed bugs basically loopholes and tightened the level of security available on Android due to that it become quite hard for Kingoroot and other rooting softwares to root latest versions of Android though there are few rooting apps build to root latest Android versions but thing is most of them used to soft brick Android devices so at that time many people stopped using one click root apps and softwares then started choosing device specific Chainfire&#8217;s SuperSu root methods from trusted platforms like XDA but thing is for whatever reasons Chainfire discontinued development of SuperSu so a lot of users begin looking for way better Android rooting software alternative to SuperSu at that time we got Magisk.</p>
<p>Magisk is free and open source modern systemless rooting software developed by TopJohnWu made to root Android 6.0 marshmallow and above smartphones which is considered as better and best alternative Android rooting software came in replacement of SuperSu that basically modify and patch boot image of Android and can root almost all Android powered smartphones with unlocked bootloader but thing is it doesn&#8217;t have any one click rooting software instead you must have PC or apps like Bugjaegar with adb tools to simply flash Magisk and root connected Android devices isn&#8217;t that easy? at the end at present Magisk is quite reliable top and popular Android rooting software widely utilized by people around the world but thing is Magisk is meant for latest Android devices and it patches original boot image to root that compromises device security thus it fail to pass safetynet due to that device and apps detect root thus many apps mainly banking related ones won&#8217;t run and work well though there are some workarounds to pass Safetynet and hide Magisk root like University Safetynet Fix, MagiskHide, Zygisk, Denylist, MagiskHide props etc yet still sometimes they do not work which is why some Android users since long time want way better and more sophisticated alternative to Magisk to root Android at that time we got KernelSU.</p>
<p>KernelSU as the name suggests is an kernel based Android rooting software that injects directly into kernel to handle processes and only work on KernelSU supported kernel Android devices so as you may know kernel work as bridge between hardware and software due to that you will get more reliable root that work much better than patched boot image based root methods like SuperSu and Magisk including that KernelSU as it&#8217;s kernel based root solution it provides core level device access with anonymity thanks to that you will get more control of root and most devices and apps usually won&#8217;t be able to detect root thus KernelSU can automatically pass Safetynet including that you will be able to install modules same as on Magisk but the problem with KernelSU is at present it doesn&#8217;t have wide device support though works best for old and lesser-known devices so you have to choose as per your needs accordingly.</p>
<p>Especially, the main advantage of KernelSU is it&#8217;s free and open sourced under GPL3 license and.by default bypass Selinux and provide whitelist control so only app that is granted root permission can access &#8220;su&#8221; other apps cannot perceive su including that KernelSU allows you to customize the uid, gid, groups, capabilities and SELinux rules of su and lock up the root power in a cage isn&#8217;t that amazing? but the problem here is you can only install KernelSU on supported kernels and the installation process of KernelSU on Android devices is can be complex for newbies as you either have to insall Kernel or complile one yourself according to guide but thing is compiling KernelSU supported GKI kernel is not easy one and things may go wrong unless you&#8217;re skilled developer with knowledge on structure of Android devices with ability to follow guide and fix things well at the end even if you have manage to get KernelSU just keep in mind KernelSU is on growing community and it does have loopholes like other root softwares which are continuously getting fixed, so do you like it? are you interested in KernelSU ? if yes let&#8217;s explore more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/how-to-run-x86_64-windows-apps-on-android-via-winlator-emulator.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/how-to-run-x86_64-windows-apps-on-android-via-winlator-emulator.webp" alt="how-to-run-x86_64-windows-apps-on-android-via-winlator-emulator" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>East or west &#8220;Windows&#8221; is one of the best if not the best operating system for PCs and laptops etc developed by Microsoft inc. back in year 1985 founded by William Henry Bill Gates ||| and Paul Allen which is paid closed source and licensed software until you pay and get license you may can&#8217;t use official software on your devices but it does provide certain windows versions for free with few updates and upgrades due to such facility and many inbuilt cool useful revolutionary technologies marketed with smart strategies in just few years of time Windows got tremendous response and popularity in market worldwide and then eventually went on to become top desktop operating system with approximately more than 40% market share globally utilized by billions of people around the world to do electronic and digital tasks on the go.</p>
<p>In sense, there are many desktop operating systems yet most people like and prefer to choose Windows as it&#8217;s been one of the very few active GUI &#8211; graphical user interface operating systems in market that gone through continuous developments and improvements over past few decades timely released by reputed multi-national conglomerate &#8220;Microsoft&#8221; who developed various versions of Windows and allowed anyone to buy license and utilize them on their devices thanks to that many individuals, companies, corporates, enterprises etc started rapidly powering up their devices and begin selling worldwide due to that Windows rised and ranked top of charts in terms of devices and userbase every year as there is huge popularity and demand for Windows to reach people faster most developers worldwide choosed to make softwares for Windows because of that Windows has more number of softwares than any other, isn&#8217;t that awesome?</p>
<p>Even though, Apple inc&#8217;s desktop graphical user interface operating system named MacOS is second interms of global market share just next to Windows and though it is well known top desktop maker founded by Steve Jobs which since long time active in development of MacOS that competing edge to edge with Windows yet for number of decades it&#8217;s struggling to beat Windows global market share mainly because Apple inc&#8217;s Mac OS is closed source specifically crafted for their products which are quite expensive and they do not provide either license or software to anyone to use on third party devices at the end it&#8217;s amazing and connected closed ecosystem due to that a lot of people sticked to MacOS and because of that MacOS was able to rise and sustain in global market where is Microsoft provide many free versions of Windows and it&#8217;s license is less expensive which can be installed on any devices as there are such benefits and flexibility on Windows most people first prefer to get it on their devices, are you one of them?</p>
<p>Usually, free and open source softwares inshort FOSS has more chances to rank on top of worldwide market share as their source code is in public domain anyone like individuals and companies etc can contribute to it and utilize as it is or build their own version of software to integrate on devices including that foss softwares are transparent so that you can simply examine full code to check and verify it&#8217;s structure and level of security based on that decide to use or not but when it comes to closed source ones they are encrypted so you won&#8217;t know what exactly is hidden in code which can cause risk to your privacy and security at the end foss softwares are way better then closed ones for instance if we look in mobile operating systems sector since past decade Android is leading foss software by Google with more than 70% worldwide market share but in case of desktop operating systems sector most foss softwares like Linux failed to beat and surpass Windows.</p>
<p>The reason why even amazing free and open source desktop operating systems like Linux, FreeBSD etc which have quite immense potential yet failed to surpass Windows is mainly because it has strong foundation build over the decades with right marketing strategies by Microsoft inc. who utilised many existing as well as launched new revolutionary technologies on Windows to make and provide one stop best possible stable up-to-date GUI based personal operating system to users and meet the ever evolving advancements in technology sector and requirements of different types of audience around the world in the process Windows basically simplified usage of operating system on PC with it&#8217;s very well crafted and designed GUI and technologies for better usability to each customer because of that it reached pretty fast to most people and developers worldwide who not just utilized and made apps but also unofficial custom mods with many additional enhancements to level up Windows and use it more efficiently and extensively to max possible effectively.</p>
<p>Microsoft Windows over the years with it&#8217;s route map and technologies inspired and become model for many other desktop operating systems and since long time Windows played huge role in the digital revolution and evolution of technologies thanks to the efforts of Microsoft team now we got modern technologies and we are able to simply use them on PCs and many other devices because of Windows incredible journey and history it gained immense popularity and success with huge loyal fanbase and customers around the world who trust and first preference is to get and load Windows on PCs as there is such demand for it Microsoft working accordingly with updates and upgrades on Windows to satisfy customers regularly.</p>
<p>Even though, Windows operating system have strong hold on desktops but not on smartphones where Android rules market but since early era of smartphones many enthusiasts and people who mainly out of curiosity and to run PC apps want to get Windows on smartphones over Android as there is high demand Microsoft in order to supply and reach more people as well as fill it&#8217;s lack of presence and build position in mobile business after long time back in year 2011 in partnership with well known top conglomerate Nokia decided to enter in smartphone business with Lumia series powered by mobile version of Windows at first they are massive hit with huge sells worldwide but eventually in the long run due to some mistakes of Microsoft and drawbacks of mobile Windows they have failed to surpass Android smartphones.</p>
<p>However, Nokia Lumia series are not the first smartphones to have mobile version of Windows prior that itself pioneer of desktop Windows operating systems Microsoft back in year 1996 developed and released mobile version of Windows utilizing Windows Embedded standared and Compact inshort Windows CE which is flexible and can be used for many devices that eventually used on handheld devices like for personal digital assistants inshort PDAs which at first appeared in year 2000 as Windows Pocket PC that was renamed as Windows Mobile in year 2003 and then as time goes in rise of Google inc. Android and Apple inc. iOS powered smartphones Microsoft in order to tackle and compete with them back in year 2010 announced super cool Windows Phone series.</p>
<p>In early 21st century Microsoft as said earlier also partnered with struggling top mobile maker Nokia inc. and made Lumia series smartphones at first they got huge hype and sells with praise for top notch hardware as well as software quality but they&#8217;ve not provided user-friendly route structure for third party developers being an closed source software due to that Windows phones got less apps and external development mainly because most people and third party developers either focused on Android or iOS as they&#8217;re way user friendly and have large userbase due to that Windows Phone sells dropped down to quite big extent except few buys from some customers as there is not even enough sells so eventually Microsoft had no choice other then to close operations of Windows Phone and software updates which was done back in year 2019 since then Windows Phone is officially ended in market though some people still buy old and refurbished ones mainly because of it&#8217;s quality hardware and ability to run PC apps but considering the specifications of the latest smartphones and various other factors at present they&#8217;re not worthy.</p>
<p>If you already own or wanna buy Windows Phone no matter it&#8217;s worthy or not then you may go ahead and get it thanks to some third party developers online who over past few years done little custom development for Windows Phones due to that you can install Android on number of Windows Lumia smartphones including that you&#8217;re able to sideload and install some extra PC apps that are not available on official store of Windows Phones so that you may drag and use them for few more years but thing is majority of people already shifted to Android which has more than 70% worldwide market share and it is FOSS as well provided user-friendly route structure of it&#8217;s technologies because of that third party developers and makers not just created millions of apps for Android but also utilised it&#8217;s Android open source project inshort AOSP to build their own versions of Android known as custom roms including that it has strong custom development from platforms like XDA and 4PDA to further extend functionalities of Android and utilise it more extensively.</p>
<p>Google over the years done many developments on it&#8217;s foss mobile operating system to further improve and advance it to next level due to that it gone through many versions on each new one they added more features and tightened security for better usability and privacy including that in general Google provided Android as open ecosystem and since the beginning they made Android by default very customizable for the benefit and better user experience of users but if you&#8217;re not satisfied with them and want more then by unlocking bootloader and installing rooting software like Chainfire SuperSu or Magisk etc you can unlock write access to system aka root partition of Android devices where you can modify files to customize system extremely at the end to do all this you either have proper guides or fixes or you may have to be a developer or knowledge on structure of Android else you may do things incorrectly that can hard or soft brick Android device which is sometimes irreparable including that rooting voids device warranty unless you live in European union inshort EU.</p>
<p>But thing is though Android is top foss flexible mobile operating system and it&#8217;s powered devices are less expensive and more customizable than closed source operating systems like iOS with capacity and ability to do most tasks of Windows desktops in their own way which is why most people want and prefer to use them yet still there are certain people who for whatever reasons want to install Windows or it&#8217;s desktop apps on Android devices at present it&#8217;s not directly possible due to a lot of differences in system hardware and software architecture though we are abe to use some launcher apps but they only provide graphical user interface and few non-system functionalities of Windows not all which is quite disappointing isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>Fortunately, as there is demand and necessity to supply and full-fill many people mainly developers around the world over the years found and made numerous indirect ways to install and run Windows and it&#8217;s desktop apps on Android devices like to name few casting, screen mirroring from physical desktop Windows or make and run Windows instances on cloud servers then connect to them on Android devices using browsers or apps like RealVNC, bVNC Viewer etc which are good but quite expensive and may always require internet data to connect and work well so it may not suit everyone that&#8217;s why some people and developers worked and looked for better way to do all this in that process they discovered one way that is currently trending and amazed people with it&#8217;s technologies is Emulator softwares.</p>
<p>Emulators, have you ever heard about them? if you&#8217;re an techy then you may probably do? if not then in order to know about emulators first we have to know how computers came into existence, so foremost as you may know in ancient times most people used to live in rural areas and for living they very much used to mainly rely and do agricultural works at that time most people had to use basic tools to do agriculture or any other works manually which is hard and take long time to get things done but as time goes in the mid 17th century we got to see began of 1st industrial revolution at that time a lot of people started leaving agriculture works and rural areas and then started settling or making rural into urban areas to setup or work in factories at that time to not just simplify but also automate and speed up the process of manufacturing goods a lot of inventors around the world build many quite revolutionary mechanical hardware based machines and technologies.</p>
<p>Mechanical machines and technologies based on pre-configuration can execute and run designated tasks automatically though their emergence dates back to ages with inventions like wheels and simple clock in 13th century but only in time of technological advancements done and occured in industrial revolution they got formed into right shape at that time by using them not just workers in factories but also other people were able to make goods and do other tasks rapidly in large scale efficiently and effectively but thing is due to the ever rising demands for goods in market with allowance and acceptance from state governments for domestic and international exports in this capitalist world made possible by wide range of facilities there is always requirement for more and more workers to make and supply goods in less or right time to customers due to that many companies used to recruit workers in large numbers and make them work for long hours at the same time a lot of inventors and makers to further level up the speed and increase capacity of production of goods not just updated and upgraded existing hardware mechanical machines and technologies but also build many new better ones.</p>
<p>ln the process of continuous developments done by companies and inventors on mechanical machines and technologies they overtime progressed and evolved to reach new levels with better feasibility to work more effectively due to that we got powerful ones so people like always not just utilised them in factories but also in other fields and sectors like for instance in transport on vehicles, photography on cameras and many more but thing is early mechanical machines and technologies are not always reliable due to their integral mechanics which are mostly powered and run by physical, steam, gas, liquid energies so many people wanted better more reliable alternative energy to power up and run mechanical machines which can pull them to max possible range at that time back in the mid 18th century we got revolutionary energy named electricity so a lot of people eventually started utilising electricity on them as they use electricity they&#8217;re known as electronic mechanical machines and technologies which turned out fruitful and useful to humankind around the world.</p>
<p>Electronic mechanical machines and technologies are considered and known as advancement to non-electronic ones and in many ways they worked out better to most people around the world which is why since the emergence of electronic mechanical machines and technologies many people like and prefer to use and stick to them in order to make or do most things and eventually by late 19th century 2nd industrial revolution began at that time most factories and people in large scale started using electronic mechanical machines and technologies to further make and do things more efficiently and effectively due to that as time goes the requirement and usage of electronic mechanical machines and technologies kept on rising in market as there is huge demand to supply many companies and inventors over the years done continuous developments and advancements on them to not just update and upgrade them but also build new revolutionary electronic mechanical machines and technologies in that process we eventually got many quite powerful and advanced ones which are now widely utilised by people globally.</p>
<p>Computer is also basically mechanical machine but thing is not all mechanical machines are considered as computer due to numerous differences in concepts and functionalities but almost all mechanical machines in one way or another helped in development and formation of computer which world&#8217;s first early prototype known as Analytical Engine used to calculate numerical value of trigonometric functions of any formula was built by well known inventor Charles Babbage who introduced concepts and functionalities of Computer by using that we can differentiate between mechanical machine and Computer due to that he is known as father of Computers at first in beginnings Computers used to be mechanical machines which are only able to do basic tasks mechanically but thanks to developments and advancements done by inventors around the world in just few decades we got to see more capable ones and eventually at one point when we got electricity so a lot of inventors and people started utilizing it on computers in that process we got electronic computers which can run tasks mechanically and electronically on the go extensively.</p>
<p>If there is any technology which turned out super useful and revolutionary then at top there will be computer as it not just simplified but also changed and transformed the way we make and use things in this world immensely but like any new technology in market at first electronic computers used to basic but as time goes eventually to progress and evolve in field of technologies many inventors continuously done a lot of developments to improve and advance electronic computers in that process by mid 90s we got powerful and advanced electronic digital computers like ENIAC and Atansoff Berry computer etc and eventually we got to see electronic stored program computers like Machester Baby Computer which can process electronic stored programs also known as digital softwares at first they are not visible but later on due to the emergence of visual softwares by connecting CRT or other supported display screen monitor to visual screening supported digital electronic computers with peripherals like keyboard we not just view or access but also control visual softwares on live accordingly.</p>
<p>Visual softwares like for instance terminal based CLI &#8211; command line interface and GUI &#8211; graphical user interface operating systems in which you can install and run compatible format software applications at the end both are basically digital softwares created by developers using programming languages like FORTRAN, BASIC, C etc but thing is at some point some inventors thought why not make and play digital game softwares utilizing technologies available on computers so in that process they developed visual moving pictures digital video games at first we used to have very few basic ones of them but eventually developers for various different usage purposes by adapting to latest technologies not just updated and upgraded them but also created many useful and amazing new digital softwares and video games and then released them publicly so that it benefit and get widely utilized by people because of that many old ones are still available to access in few offline and online sources worldwide.</p>
<p>But, thing is though in mid 19th century itself we got to see many visual digital softwares and video games yet at that time electronic computers used to be quite expensive and large like in size of car or big room due to that it was very much limited to some people and companies like IBM who used to afford and own most computers but thing is a lot of people like and want to own computer to not just use it&#8217;s hardware but also it&#8217;s digital softwares and play video games as there is demand to supply and make computers in a way to be reachable for everyone many inventors inventors and companies for number of decades by adapting to numerous latest technologies done a lot of updates and upgrades on computers to advance and improve them in that process by late 90s we got small size electronic computers known as personal computers inshort PCs they&#8217;ll fits in small space like on table so that most people can carry and use them on the go conveniently and comfortably.</p>
<p>However, though by late 90s era itself we got to see compact small size PCs but still the price of them used to be expensive so most people were unable to afford them instead many of them used to work with them in offices or lend PCs from someone who already own to use digital softwares and play video games even people used to pay and use PCs in some stores like we now use internet in Cyber Cafes at the end all this process is inconvenient so a lot of people wanted low price affordable home PCs to use them conveniently as there is demand thanks to huge competiton in this capitalist world many inventors eventually made and released affordable PCs back in year 1970s yet still there are some people for whatever reasons can&#8217;t get or afford them out of them many people just only want to play digital video games of PC not softwares at low price possible as there is requirement to full-fill back in year 1971 inventors Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney in partnership as Syzygy engineering made and released the world&#8217;s first arcade video game machine named Computer Space.</p>
<p>Computer Space is revolutionary affordable arcade machine which comes with pay and use model specifically made for business owners to use in malls and stores etc where people can go and use them to play computer digital video games for some time but thing is eventually for whatever reasons Computer Space got losses and it&#8217;s founders went on to found a gaming company named Atari though Computer Space is failed product yet it&#8217;s something definitely remarkable and has future which is why number of companies utilised and got inspired by the template and technologies of Computer Space created their own arcade video game machines at first they are basic but eventually many inventors and companies continuously done a lot of developments on arcade video game machines with many updates and upgrades to improve and advance them further to next level in that process we got quite powerful and advanced arcade machines with their own custom video games which are widely used and played by people globally.</p>
<p>Arcade video game machines amazed and worked like wonder and saviour to many people to relax and enjoy who&#8217;s life became busy due to work or for whatever reasons can&#8217;t or unable to play physical games including that mainly most kids, children, teens who usually have more free time not just show interest but also like and want to play digital video games over physical ones due to that in just few years demand and market for arcade machines and it&#8217;s video games grown exponentially but thing is at the end they&#8217;re not one time purchase and it&#8217;s not always possible to go somewhere to get arcade machines and play video games right? including that they are big and not made for homes so even if you have space and got them placed in your arena after that you may have to spend more time and spend high maintenance fees else they won&#8217;t work well which is why a lot of people wanted better and more comfortable way to play video games as there is demand to supply back in year 1972 Magnavox developed and released fantastic world&#8217;s first video game console named The Odyssey.</p>
<p>Magnavox&#8217;s The Odyssey is revolutionary home video game console which is small size so you can simply move and use it almost everywhere even connect it to television and play it&#8217;s video games using joystick controller isn&#8217;t that amazing? but at the end due to some reasons eventually it&#8217;s failed but it&#8217;s something remarkable and has future like Computer Space which is why many companies utilised and got inspired by template and technologies of Magnavox The Odyssey created and released their own home video game consoles at first they are basic but many inventors and companies to progress and evolve done a lot of developments with updates and upgrades on home video game consoles to improve and advance them further to next level in that process now we have powerful and advanced modern home video game console like PlayStation and Xbox they have fabulous games which are better and some of them are not even available to play on PCs.</p>
<p>Majority of people switched to home video game consoles from arcade machines as they&#8217;re much way better easy to use and flexible ones but thing is by year 1990s PCs become more affordable including that we also got to see emergence of world wide web basically to access public internet which is revolutionary so large percentage of people started buying and using PCs mainly to get access to internet, in addition to other softwares and games etc but thing is PCs though compact size not handheld devices so you can&#8217;t simply move and use them on go which is why a lot of people wanted better way alternative to use them as there is demand to supply some companies developed and released revolutionary handheld PCs also known as personal digital assistants inshort PDAs which are good but they got less userbase as most people didn&#8217;t show much interest into them instead preffered regular PCs to utilise softwares and mobile phones to communicate with people worldwide.</p>
<p>Mobile phones are basically evolution of Telephones at first most of them are wired and big in size but over the years many inventors and companies done a lot of developments and advancements on mobile phones due to that by 20th century we got to see small size wireless keypad mobile phones with ability to install and run small tiny size operating systems and apps but thing is they are no match for PCs so a lot of people wanted way better alternative to them as there is demand to supply Apple inc. back in year 2007 developed and released revolutionary world&#8217;s first multi-touch technology smartphone named iPhone which is basically evolution of PDAs and mobile phones though world&#8217;s first smartphone is IBM (SPC) but iPhone can be said as first modern one and thanks to it&#8217;s quite path breaking technologies a lot of people want to own and use it though it&#8217;s expensive product and eventually many companies around the world to compete with iPhones and make business started making and releasing less expensive smartphones.</p>
<p>iPhone smartphone&#8217;s hardware and software basically it&#8217;s operating system which they eventually named as iOS is advanced and awesome but it&#8217;s closed source and ecosystem so no one can use it on their devices unless they get proper license from Apple inc. who since the beginning didn&#8217;t provided that to anyone due to that back then most mobile makers wanted alternative operating system that&#8217;s better than iOS though top mobile makers like Nokia and Samsung can make super high quality smartphones but thing is they used to struggle in finding and making finest mobile operating system as it&#8217;s not easy and usually may take years to build proper one for their smartphones that can match level of range and technologies of iOS at that time fortunately in just 1 year back in year 2008 top search engine giant Google developed and released free and open source software named Android.</p>
<p>Android is open source mobile operating system which source code was released as Android open source project inshort AOSP so anyone can use it thanks to that many developers and companies by using AOSP build their own versions of Android to power up devices as Android is free it&#8217;s powered smartphones are less expensive and affordable so most people around the world preferred to buy and use Android smartphones over iPhones due to that in just few years Android got huge userbase and eventually became global top mobile operating system which now has more than 70% worldwide market share but thing is at first most Android or any other operating system powered smartphones used to be basic isn&#8217;t it? and as time goes many inventors and companies around the world to progress and evolve done a lot of developments with updates and upgrades on smartphones to improve and advance them further to next level in that process by 21st century we have quite powerful and advanced modern smartphones.</p>
<p>Now a days, majority of people around the world widely using handheld modern smartphones more than PCs as they can do almost all tasks of PC in it&#8217;s own way but thing is at the end due to system hardware and software architecture differences you can&#8217;t directly install and run PC&#8217;s operating systems and apps on smartphones and vice versa but you can indirectly do that by utlilizing emulator softwares so if you&#8217;re someone who for nostalgia or whatever reasons wanna use old desktop or mobile operating systems and apps then now it&#8217;s better to not buy old PCs or smartphones as most makers stopped making new ones long time ago which are rare now though you may get some used or refurbished ones from few online or offline sources but they&#8217;re quite expensive and not worthy to most people unless you&#8217;re an collector and trying to preserve them which is why incase if you are someone who just out of curiosity or casually wanna use old desktop or mobile operating system and apps then it&#8217;s better to use emulator softwares as at present we have such ones which can play almost all desktop or mobile operating systems and apps easily for paid and free.</p>
<p>Emulator softwares basically create and provide virtual environment by emulating system hardware and software of PC&#8217;s or smartphones etc digitally inside it&#8217;s software which is basically like nutshell same as operating system, virtual machine etc so that you can simply but indirectly able to install and run other devices different architecture operating systems or apps but thing is currently most emulator softwares are developed and released by third party developers who usually are not associated with official makers so they&#8217;re considered as unofficial emulators including that emulation of hardware and software is quite hard and difficult as third party developers don&#8217;t get any help from official makers due to that from scratch they most likely have to make each and every file and technologies and then debug to fix bugs by themselves or based on feedback from users which usually take long time that&#8217;s why a lot of unofficial emulators stay in early access, alpha and beta stage for few years and struggle to become stable one.</p>
<p>Thankfully, from past decade many developers to fastrack development of their unofficial emulators releasing their software code as free and open source through public repositories on contributive development platforms like GitHub and GitHub etc due to that they&#8217;ve become transparent so that anyone from internet can check the code to verify it&#8217;s level of authenticity and security based on that decide to use or not at the same time as software code is in public domain anyone can commit their own code to update or upgrade them that speed up development and advancement to big extent thanks to that now a days in less time we&#8217;re able to see stable versions of unofficial emulators including that there are numerous benefits with open source unofficial emulators like since long time many developers by using source code not just able to port unofficial emulators of PCs to smartphones and vice versa but also develop their own custom versions of unofficial emulators by adding additional enhancements as they want or like mainly to optimize or improve based on needs accordingly, fabulous right?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most unofficial software emulators are only available for PC as since long time and at present PCs are more quite powerful and advanced than smartphones which can handle things better due to that many third party developers specifically like and prefer to focus on making of unofficial software emulators for PCs over smartphones but thing is as said earlier many mobile makers around the world as time goes from past decade continuously kept on updating and upgrading hardware and software of smartphones as per usage requirements of people by adapting to latest technologies due to that now we got to see powerful and advanced modern smartphones which are in range of PCs including that a lot of people want PC&#8217;s unofficial software emulators on their smartphones as there is huge demand and quite capable smartphones from past few years many developers also like and want to focus on making new ones or port PC&#8217;s unofficial emulators for smartphones due to that now most unofficial emulators are available for smartphones yet some high tech ones are still not available which may be so soon available in future for sure.</p>
<p>The world&#8217;s first emulator is built by IBM corporation back in year 1963 on their IBM System/360 computers after that many companies build their own emulators for their computers and other devices at first most emulators used to be basic but eventually many inventors and companies to progress and evolve done a lot of developments by adapting to latest technologies with updates and upgrades on emulators to improve and advance them further to next level in that process now we got powerful and advanced modern emulators though at first emulator softwares are limited to computer desktop operating systems and apps but eventually by early 20th century many developers as there is demand to supply developed and released number of amazing emulator softwares to run arcade machine and home console video games on PCs.</p>
<p>Many third party developers around the world over the years done a lot of developments and advancements on arcade and home console video game emulators thanks to that by early 21st century we got to see many powerful and advanced ones not only for PCs but also for smartphones but thing is back in 20th century most emulator softwares which can emulate other devices operating systems and apps used to be only available for PCs like for instance to name few popular ones VMware, BlueStacks while VMware can emulate desktop operating systems as well as softwares then comes BlueStacks which emulate Android operating system and apps on PCs but thing is many people want to emulate desktop operating systems and softwars on smartphones as well due to lack of such emulators some people used to struggle and as there is no option used to rely to PCs but now in 21st century from past few years as there is demand and requirements to full-fill some third party developers created and released some unofficial emulators to emulate desktop and mobile operating systems and apps on smartphones, isn&#8217;t that fascinating?</p>
<p>Apple inc&#8217;s iPhone series smartphones hardware and operating system named iOS is closed source and encrypted so unless you get proper license or decrypt it you can&#8217;t emulate iOS on other devices which is hard and difficult thing that&#8217;s why most developers not yet able to make softwares to emulate iOS instead they focused on Android as it&#8217;s open source operating system many third party developers already created and released numerous unofficial emulators to run CLI and GUI desktop operating systems and softwares on Android powered smartphones like Limbo, Exagear and many more at first they used to be basic but eventually many inventors and companies to progress and evolve done a lot of developments by adapting to latest technologies with updates and upgrades to improve and advance them further to next level in that process now we got many powerful and advanced modern emulators but thing is at the end if you just want to specifically emulate Windows operating system and apps on Android devices then at present Winlator Emulator is trending online.</p>
<p>Recently, we got to know about an free and open source unofficial emulator named Winlator developed and released by Brunodev85 which is specifically crafted to run Windows operating system by using that you can simply install and run x64 and x86 bit apps and games with Wine and Box86/Box64 on Android smartphones but if you for whatever reason can&#8217;t or don&#8217;t want to use Winlator or any other emulator softwares instead needed better alternative way to somehow run Windows on Android then you may dual boot Windows on Android at first only PCs used to be able to dual boot desktop or mobile operating systems on PCs but eventually we got dual boot functionality on Android devices as well at first they used to only able to dual boot Android operating system custom roms but eventually some third party developers created and released free and open source Renegade Project by using that you can install and run Windows 10/11 on some arm64 bit Qualcomm Snapdragon chipset Android powered smartphones though the installation procedure is not easy one.</p>
<p>if your Android smartphone or chipset is not available in supported list of Renegade Project and there is other way available to somehow dual boot or install and run Windows on Android then it&#8217;s better to use emulator softwares though we have many of them mainly closed source ones like Exagear to run Windows and it&#8217;s apps but the problem here with closed source softwares is as their code is encrypted you won&#8217;t know if developers of them integrated any malicious code inside them unless you can decrypt or properly scan them through antivirus softwares which are sometimes undetectable that can cause risk to your privacy and security where is free and open source ones code will be in public domain so they provide transparency thus you&#8217;ll be able to check and assure of it&#8217;s authenticity and level of security based on that decide to use or not which is why it&#8217;s better to go with free and emulator like Winlator Emulator to always stay in safe zone so do you like it? are you interested? if yes then let&#8217;s explore more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/how-to-create-bootlogo-and-boot-animations-on-android-devices.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-14459" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/how-to-create-bootlogo-and-boot-animations-on-android-devices-768x431-1-300x168.webp" alt="" width="300" height="168" srcset="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/how-to-create-bootlogo-and-boot-animations-on-android-devices-768x431-1-300x168.webp 300w, https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/how-to-create-bootlogo-and-boot-animations-on-android-devices-768x431-1.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Back in early era of smartphones Android used to be basic mobile operating system with less features and mediocre GUI aka graphical user interface yet it&#8217;s great back then as smartphones are basic as well while Android is new and revolutionary one at that time for most people basic Android stuff is enough and satisfactory but as time goes we got way better poweful and advanced amazing technologies in market so makers in order to improve and provide the rising demands of people integrated and adapted them on smartphones and Android due to that now they are modern and feature rich with material GUI design which can do most tasks of desktops at the end they are fabulous but good is not good enough right? which is why most makers and users around the world strive hard to make or get better ones, isn&#8217;t it?</span></p>
<p>Eventhough, most makers mainly for commercial reasons and to compete with fellow makers continuously working on to improve existing and in parallel inventing and integrating many new super cool modern technologies on mobile operating systems and smartphones to provide way better electronic and digital products to users at the same time progress and be part in evolution of technologies to next level but thing is even if final product is very good still there is always space for improvements including that certain users for whatever reasons like and want to do some or extensive changes on products to get desired results as it improves product with increase in usefulness and flexibility but thing is certain products for various different reasons lock and won&#8217;t let you do any changes on ecosystem of product without right keys, dissapointing right?</p>
<p>In sense, there are certain products which by default made in a way like in form of physical design or encryption on electronic and digital technologies to not let anyone except the maker to do any changes like for instance iOS a well known mobile operating system developed for popular iPhone series smartphones by Apple inc. is encrypted and it&#8217;s code is closed source so unless you get rights or somehow can bypass or decrypt software you won&#8217;t be able to make changes which does provide more privacy and security to makers and users but it closes space for any further development from people which is good sometimes but not always as if there is open space users can make changes as per them according to situation and time to make it way better than existing one that&#8217;s why a lot of people like to get open source products, are you one of them?</p>
<p>Android is well known operating system founded by Andy Rubens but eventually acquired by Google inc. which in order to compete with iOS and iPhone was further developed and then first released on few selected smartphones build in partnership with some company by Google like HTC but unlike Apple inc. in order to grow and widen it&#8217;s userbase and provide way better user experience to users back in beginning itself Google got one smart idea to publish Android as free and open source software in name of Android open source project inshort AOSP on internet by using that anyone mainly companies and third party developers not just make custom builds of Android with their own optimizations and enhancements but also contribute code to AOSP including that as code is in public domain with transparency it provides way more security thanks to it&#8217;s flexibility most people like to have Android on devices.</p>
<p>However, even if certain products are made in a way by default to not let anyone make changes still by somehow exploiting in whichever way possible you can make changes on them like when it comes to digital technologies they are basically software developed using programming languages like C, Java, Ruby, Python etc for instance if we look into iOS as said earlier it&#8217;s closed source encrypted mobile operating system and software so unless with right keys you can&#8217;t decrypt but thing is at the end it is made up of code and on most products you&#8217;ll find loopholes also known as bugs on softwares if you find and exploit them you can break system of products that&#8217;s how third party developers finded way to break iOS to change and remove it&#8217;s restrictions that method is known as Jailbreak which is continuously being updated by developers to support and break latest iPhone smartphones.</p>
<p>But, in case of Android it&#8217;s open source thus it&#8217;s more customizable than iOS on that you won&#8217;t find hard restrictions which you will get on iOS and you don&#8217;t have to exploit and break system software to do most things like to name few you can install third party apps from anywhere by simply checking installation from unknown sources option from settings and you can flash custom boot logos and animations and many more with just smartphone or with help of PC at the end such feats are currently not possible on iOS but thing is if you want more customization and change things at system level on Android then you have to install rooting softwares created by third party developers which break and unlock write access on system partition like SuperSu which is discontinued now but after that we got way better rooting software named Magisk for latest modern smartphones at the end rooting allows you to do things efficiently and extensively.</p>
<p>Anyhow, rooting voids device warranty unless you live in european union inshort eu but if you just want to flash boot logos and animations on Android then as said earlier you don&#8217;t have to root Android though most people know about boot logos and animations but if you don&#8217;t then for you in simple they basically show up when you power on smartphone which is sign that operating system is installed and trying to get into it thanks to Google who made many amazing unique boot logos and animations for all Android versions including that as Android is open source OEMs also created and added their own custom boot logos and animations which are nice but thing is for whatever reason if don&#8217;t want them instead like to make and add your own custom one but don&#8217;t know how? then you are now at right place.</p>
<p>There are many root and non-root methods to make and flash boot logos and boot animations on Android powered devices and installation is different which is based on type of processor and Android version and build types etc for instance you may can&#8217;t apply method and software you used to flash bootlogos on Qualcomm Snapdragon processors on Mediatek and Exynos processors etc as they usually are not compatible and mostly won&#8217;t work mainly due to different system structure and resources which is why you have to choose and apply right method to flash boot logos and animations else it may softbrick or hardbrick your Android device which is sometimes irreparable so always be careful to not let that happen we tried to provide steps below to flash bootlogos and animations on most processors used on Android devices, so do you like it? are you interested? if yes let&#8217;s explore more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/how-to-increase-ram-on-android-smartphones-using-scene.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/how-to-increase-ram-on-android-smartphones-using-scene.webp" alt="how-to-increase-ram-on-android-smartphones-using-scene" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>Random access memory inshort RAM is basically volatile memory that stores data in background temporarily until it get power supplied on electronic devices at first in beginning RAM used to be small size yet it&#8217;s enough as back in time we used to have minimal capacity electronic devices but as time goes we got powerfull and advanced ones so in order to handle them in parallel many companies created and integrated modern RAMs though there are numerous different types of RAM but the latest one that since past few decades and now most people around the world using is double data rate dynamic RAM inshort DDR which over the years gone through continuous developments due to that now we have DDR 5th generation at the end DDR is modern and big in size that can hold and run data more efficiently.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, static ram aka S-RAM uses transistors to hold and run data which is faster and doesn&#8217;t refresh data but it&#8217;s quite expensive and most device makers at present usually integrate S-RAM on limited and high end electronic devices where is DDR RAM use both transistors and capacitors to hold and run data which has refresh rate of few milliseconds so you won&#8217;t notice it that basically refreshes background data whenever it&#8217;s lost and make it stay active as long as possible until sufficient RAM is available and power is supplied at the end DDR is quite less expensive and only bit less faster than DDR which is why most companies and people around the world widely like and want to power up their electronic devices using DRAM, are you one of them?</p>
<p>There are many different types and various sizes of S-RAM and D-RAM based on the RAM type and size you will find number of transistors they&#8217;re basically containers of RAM which stores data and when it comes to capacitors they work is to store electric power and supply to transistors whenever necessary to let RAM flow work properly including that in RAM you&#8217;ll get L1, L2 and L3 cache which all are small size while L1 and L2 are widely used on most electronic devices but when it comes to servers we specifically use L3 cache which is bigger than L1 and L2 cache at the end L1, L2, or L3 caches are basically used to store and load most frequently used data on system till some time like for instance if you open a document whichever data it has based on size if it&#8217;s small it&#8217;ll get stored in L1 and if it&#8217;s big it&#8217;ll get stored in L2 or L3 so that you will be able to access data quickly.</p>
<p>You may say why do we need L1, L2, L3 cache when RAM already stores data in background till power supplied though it may does store and load frequently used data like documents, songs, gifs, photos etc but as said earlier L1, L2, L3 caches are small sizes so how they can or what exactly happen if there is heavy resources big software apps and games? see in such scenario most people use L3 cache which is also small size but it doesn&#8217;t store and load full data of apps instead it store and fetch directories of files so that software apps or games will load faster as system has the preloaded directories cache data so that it can understand and handle them well at the end it&#8217;s always better to go with good big size RAM more then required so that you can use the system data quickly and smoothly as possible on the go.</p>
<p>RAM is important thing as even if you don&#8217;t have ROM or any other storage still with just RAM you can boot operating system but without RAM device will not going to boot operating system for sure including that if you have less insufficient RAM on Android smartphones it will cause various different issues like quite slow speed and laggyness in system and it can also cause system crashes and bootloops etc which is why it&#8217;s very important to have big and sufficient RAM for smooth and effective functioning of system units at first back in early era of Android we used to have less RAM size smartphones but eventually as time goes we got advancements and huge demand in market around the world for big RAM Android smartphones thanks to huge demand to supply many companies begin making and releasing them worldwide due to that now we are now able to multi-task big data system resources effectively.</p>
<p>Eventhough, most people usually have and use big RAM size Android smartphones as from past few years most device makers providing big RAM on almost all latest smartphones to attract users and mainly to work as per requirements of current updated and upgraded technologies including that some device makers by default even providing system option to increase virtual RAM by utilizing internal storage super cool technology right? but there is chance you may be using old Android smartphone or even if it&#8217;s latest one it may have less RAM or may be it does have big RAM but it may be not enough for you etc in such scenarios you either have to buy new big RAM Android smartphone or if you don&#8217;t want then you can root Android but in order to do that first you have to unlock bootloader which wipe data so kindly backup after that you can install rooting software on Android at the end it voids device warranty unless you are living in European Union inshort EU.</p>
<p>There are number of rooting softwares when you install them you will get write access to system partition on Android where you can make right changes to system root files to not only increase RAM but also customize Android extensively at first with root apps like Kingoroot in one click they by using ChainFire SuperSu root software was able to root almost all old Android version based smartphones but it was discontinued back in year 2017 at that time developer TopJohnWu created and released rooting software named Magisk which is systemless and far way better than ChainFire SuperSu made for Android 6.0 marshmallow and above smartphones but thing is you can&#8217;t install Magisk using rooting apps instead first you have to patch system boot image using Magisk and then use CMD terminal to flash that on Android at the end this process require PC but you can use apps like Bugjaegar.</p>
<p>In early era of Android smartphones we used to have less inbuilt storage space smartphones like few megabytes or gigabytes which is why Android used to provide option to move apps to external storage basically SD card on compatible devices but eventually this option was removed by Android as we got big storage smartphones at that time many third party developers build root apps like App2SD, App Mgr ||| etc to move apps to SD card which work on almost all Android versions but thing is sometimes just moving apps to SD card is not enough right? which is why third party developers created number of softwares and methods to format and use SD card as internal storage for rooted Android smartphones, amazing right?</p>
<p>But, in order to use SD card as internal storage first you to format SD card into fat32 or any other type as per developer or you can also make partitions of SD card to make one as internal storage and other as external storage but thing is you need to have top class quality SD card with fast read and write speed so that it can work well as internal storage or else you may face glitches, slow and laggyness while using Android smartphones which is why some people don&#8217;t want to make SD card as internal storage though it work very well on old Android smartphones but it&#8217;s not recommended on latest ones though Android even on latest versions of Android providing option to format any SD card as internal storage but they officially do not provide option to use internal storage or SD card as RAM, disappointing isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>However, there are some unofficial ways to use SD card as RAM which back in time were widely used by a lot of people on old Android smartphones but again you need to have top class quality SD card with fast read and write speed so that it can work well as internal storage or else you may face glitches, slow and laggyness while using Android smartphones though there are number of unofficial methods to use internal storage as RAM and also as said earlier some makers like Xiaomi on some latest custom Android smartphones even provide option to use internal storage as RAM but this option is currently limited so you usually won&#8217;t find this option on stock AOSP based pure Android builds and most custom Android device makers at present don&#8217;t provide them but don&#8217;t worry there is chances they&#8217;ll provide it in near future.</p>
<p>In case, you&#8217;re someone who use AOSP builds or custom roms like LineageOS or CrDroid, Bootleggers etc or OEM builds like ColorOS, FIUI, ROGUI, MYUI etc at present they won&#8217;t provide option to use internal storage as RAM but still if you somehow unofficially want to use internal storage as RAM then you&#8217;re at right place there is an proffesional app named Scene to manage and customize Android quite extensively and efficiently by using that you can convert certain amount of internal storage as RAM but it work on Android 10 Q and above versions so very likely require Magisk to work on smartphone if you have it then you&#8217;re good to go at the end doing anything incorrectly can soft or hardbrick Android smartphone which is sometimes irreparable so to not let that happen kindly follow our below provided all step-by-step detailed instructions carefully thus you&#8217;ll be able to convert internal storage as RAM and use it effectively, so do you like it? are you interested? if yes let&#8217;s explore more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/how-to-install-gapps-on-android-without-custom-recovery-using-magisk.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/how-to-install-gapps-on-android-without-custom-recovery-using-magisk.webp" alt="how-to-install-gapps-on-android-without-custom-recovery-using-magisk" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>Alphabet inc. as you may know is the company founded by Larry page and Sergey brin which own many digital products out of them Google a search engine and Android a free and open source software basically operating system are most popular ones widely used by people around the world on almost all electronic devices mainly on PCs and smartphones to do many different things electronically and digitally at first they used to be basic but thanks to over the year advancements done by developers globally for various purposes due to that now we have modern ones which can do tasks more efficiently and effectively by utilizing essential and required resources on the go, isn&#8217;t that quite fantastic?</p>
<p>Especially, when it comes to AndroidOS which was actually developed by Andy Rubens back in year 2005 but later on back in year 2008 Google buyed Android and eventually released it&#8217;s source code publicly on AOSP aka Android open source project by using them not just companies anyone can build their own version of Android and power up their devices for free thanks to that almost all companies shown interest and integrated Android on devices including that many third party developers using AOSP build custom roms to upgrade or update devices and keep them uptodate due to that now Android has more than 70% worldwide market share and it&#8217;s keep on rising giving edge to edge tough competition to closed source operating systems like Apple inc&#8217;s iOS.</p>
<p>In sense, Android is quite potential amazing cross platform operating system that at first even now mainly used on smartphones but the problem here is Google first release new Android updates and give support to it&#8217;s devices like Nexus and Pixel series after them only other makers can build their own versions of Android to do any enhancements and power up devices though Google provide few years of software updates but thing is when it comes to most device makers they only give one or two updates or upgrades while some not even provide them due to that with in 1 or 2 years device become outdated that&#8217;s something most people don&#8217;t like and want to happen for sure which is why many third party developers build and released super cool AOSP based custom roms and GSIs on platforms like XDA to keep user devices uptodate.</p>
<p>Google is first to build and release AndroidOS on it&#8217;s devices so Android software provided by Google is considered as stock Android aka stock rom which is basically pure software form of AOSP though it&#8217;s pretty good which is why most makers like to build and power up devices with pure or bit enhanced stock Android but there are many makers for whatever commercial reasons make extensive enhancements custom Android builds with number of different skins like for instance Xiaomi&#8217;s MIUI, Samsung&#8217;s OneUI, FIUI etc which have seperate fanbase but at the end the problem here is except Google most device makers mainly on old low and mid end devices don&#8217;t give latest versions of Android due to that you either have to buy new smartphones or rely on custom roms, GSIs, root apps and mods etc.</p>
<p>In stock Android you usually find many system apps required for proper working of Android and number of pre-installed user apps which are external thus you can simply uninstall anytime at the end they are basically digital products of Google which were continuously developed and integrated on Android widely known as Google Apps inshort GApps but thing is some devices makers on custom Android builds include their own apps along with GApps for benefit of them and users while few makers like Huawei on some stock and mainly on custom Android builds don&#8217;t even provide GApps except essential core system apps so if you are someone who use GApps regularly but system doesn&#8217;t have them by default don&#8217;t worry you can simply add GApps externally on the go.</p>
<p>Nowadays, most makers trying their best to integrate and supply stock Android and GApps on devices as they are not only useful but have huge demand from users worldwide but thing is as stock Android is pure form of AOSP you&#8217;ll only get features provided by Google though they are very much enough for most users but if you want more features and external apps in that case you have to use custom oem based Android builds like Asus&#8217;s ROGUI, Motorola&#8217;s MyUI, ColorOS, FuntouchOS etc which on top of stock Android provide few or some additional features, skins, themes etc though they&#8217;re good yet for some users it&#8217;s not enough while many users only like to use pure stock Android but want some extra features if you are one of them then you have to use custom Android roms.</p>
<p>Custom Android roms are mainly based on AOSP and LineageOS sources developed by third party developers around the world like Pixel Extended, CrDroid, AncientOS, Evolution X and many more which on top of stock Android provide many additional options and features for better usage of Android devices but thing is they are made for specific devices if you&#8217;re device or it&#8217;s processor don&#8217;t have or support them then you can&#8217;t keep device uptodate which is bit disappointing isn&#8217;t it? but wait back in year 2017 on Android Oreo 8 to fix OEM&#8217;s slow or no updates Google build and released Project Treble by using them developers can build GSIs aka generic system images which are basically pure implementation of Android without code changes so any supported devices can run them well.</p>
<p>However, on most GSI and custom Android roms third party developers don&#8217;t include GApps as they are proprietary of Google and using them without right permissions from Google can cause legal issues but there are many skilled developers who developed number of different GApps packages like mini, pico, basic, full etc so that as per needs you can choose the right package and install them externally at present there are many providers of GApps like BitGApps, NikGApps etc though you may say i can install GApps myself why i need them but thing is installing apps one after one takes time which is why having GApps packages is wise choice at the end in order to install GSIs or custom roms and GApps packages on Android devices first of all you have to unlock bootloader and flash them through custom recovery like TWRP which voids device warranty unless you live in european union inshort EU.</p>
<p>Even though, majority of Android device techy users and geeks don&#8217;t hesitate in unlocking bootloader and flashing custom recovery to install GApps but thing is many devices doesn&#8217;t have custom recovery though you can install custom GApps using ADB aka Android debug bridge on CMD terminal but it requires PC while there are some users who neither want to use ADB or custom recovery instead want better alternative way to install GApps, are you one of them? if so back then we don&#8217;t have any other ways but in recent times few third party developers build numerous systemless Magisk GApps modules for latest versions of Android like A12, A13 so that you&#8217;ll be able to install GApps more easily but note installing them on old Android versions may soft or hard brick devices which is sometimes irreparable.</p>
<p>Magisk is basically rooting software which unlock write access of system partition on Android devices so that in whichever way you can customize and modify Android software as you want and like extensively which provide Magisk Manager app in that you&#8217;ll get modules section where you have to flash and manage systemless Magisk GApps but they only work on some OEMs, custom roms and GSIs so always check details before you flash them at the end there are number of providers of Magisk Systemless GApps but recently we got to know about one which is modification of NikApps by Wacko1805 for 64bit Android 11+ devices that work on almost all AOSP custom and OEM roms except on bloated stock roms like oneui and coloros etc.</p>
<p>Anyhow, Wacko1805 as of now provide 4 foss aka free and open source packages of GApps namely Stock, Basic, Core, GMS as said earlier they are based on custom recovery flashable NikGApps but by using a creator script they were converted into Magisk Module so that you can install temporarily as you can uninstall or you may say remove from Magisk Manager including that you can use it to change previously installed GApps packages and also update them without wiping data partition easily but remember do not flash them on unsupported Android versions and devices though you may try at your own risk at the end we&#8217;re not responsible for any kind personal or financial losses occurred to you, so do you like it? are you still interested in NikGApps based MagiskGApps? if yes then let&#8217;s explore more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/how-to-move-apps-from-internal-storage-to-sd-card-on-android-devices.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/how-to-move-apps-from-internal-storage-to-sd-card-on-android-devices.webp" width="400" alt="how-to-move-apps-from-internal-storage-to-sd-card-on-android-devices"></a></p>
<p>Storage is basically term denoted for certain free space in area or container in which you can store whatever things you want as long as free space available like not totally occupied and full which is of 2  types physical and electronic storage both are widely used worldwide when it comes to physical we store material objects and then in electronic one we store digital files like audio, video, documents etc in various different structures and formats like .mp4, .hevc, .mkv, .pdf, .jpg  etc at the end each and every material and digital thing based on it&#8217;s capacity and technology usually has it&#8217;s own shape and size so always better to get big storage space as high as possible according to needs so that you will be able to store more things efficiently on go.</p>
<p>Eventhough, there is physical storage for material things but it goes out of topic so as per context we&#8217;re going to specifically focus on electronic storage which is basically non volatile electronic memory that we use on most electronic devices like PCs, smartphones, music players etc which can store data permanently thought over the years inventors created number of different types of electronic memory but the modern one which we are widely using around the world is electronically erasable read only memory inshort EEPROM that technology at present is integrated mainy on HDDs aka hard disk drives and SSDs aka sold state drives they  both are amazing but difference here is HDDs are less price and store recorded data using platters while SSDs are quite expensive and use flash memory which is way more modern and faster than HDDs so as per requirements use right one.</p>
<p>Nowadays, most makers integrating HDDs on electronic devices and a lot of people like and prefer to use them over SSDs because HDDs are less expensive and does job pretty well though in parrallel SSDs are also in wide usage and it also has potential to fully replace HDDs in future but at present considering userbase SSDs are not upto level of HDDs at the end HDD or SDD are available in different sizes and capacities from kbs aka kilobytes to zbs aka zetabytes which when integrated and comes inbuild on electronic devices like PCs or smartphones it is considered as internal storage of device where you can store OS and whatever digital files you want easily thought if you got big internal storage most likely you don&#8217;t have to worry but if you have small HDD or SSD or you are someone who wanna store files which exceed capacity of internal storage in that case you may have to depend and connect external storages to electronic devices.</p>
<p>You may probably already aware of external storages like portable HDDs and SSDs, pendrives, SD cards they can be connected to electronic devices to use as additional storage space when internal one is not enough or for whatever reason you want secondary storage thought you can store almost all digital files on external storage but moving and running certain system files and resources is not possible unless system allows device thought on most PC operating systems by simply enabling superadminstator you can move and run system resources on external storages but when it comes to smartphone operating systems like Android it&#8217;s bit hard as you have to first unlock bootloader and install rooting softwares like SuperSu or Magisk to get write access to system partition after that only you&#8217;ll be able to move and run system resources on external storages but thing is all this process voids device warranty.</p>
<p>Android is well known popular mobile operating system which is basically free and open source software released by Google that currently has more than 70% worldwide and over the years rapidly gone through many developements to make it modern one suitable and flexible for most users at first in early versions of Android thought not all system resources but if device support SD card we used to get option to move system apps to SD card but for whatever reason Google removed move app to SD card option in the latest versions of Android and introduced format as SD card option that let you use your external SD card as internal storage which is pretty useful for those who have less internal storage and wanna increase it but thing is for a lot of people it&#8217;s not always possible to use SD card as internal storage right? If possible better try to keep them seperate so that you&#8217;ll have internal as well as external storage to use effectively.</p>
<p>But, the problem here is it&#8217;s not always possible to store certain system resources on internal storage isn&#8217;t it? mainly because they occupy so much space for instance when it comes to software applications of Android OS which are known as apps available in format .apk when they get installed on device if .apk size and it&#8217;s resources are big then they occupy a lot of space on internal storage including that when you keep on using and storing data on app it stores user cache that further decrease space of internal storage which is something a lot of people don&#8217;t want to happen and wish to store Android apps on secondary storage SD card so that they can have more space on primary internal storage but as said earlier on new Android versions Google removed move app to SD card option so now to move apps to SD card for that we have to use root apps they&#8217;ll do all process quite efficiently.</p>
<p>We have many amazing root apps which have functionality to move apps to sd card but the problem here is many root apps are paid and most of them ask you to make secondary partition or format SD card to move apps which wipe existing user data including that many move apps to sd card apps are limited in features and out of them most are outdated and only available for old Android versions that&#8217;s because back in early era of Android OS we used to have small storage capacity smartphones so at that time it&#8217;s important for a lot of people to must have move app to SD card app as without them device is bit difficult to use as there is demand most developers used to keep them up to date but now we are getting big storage capacity smartphones so for most people internal storage is enough to keep almost everything but still there are some people  who want reliable root app to move apps to SD card safely, are you one of them?</p>
<p>The reason why some people want to move apps to SD card is mainly because many low and mid end smartphones come with less storage space thought on high end ones we get big storage space but for some users it&#8217;s not enough at the end  mostly such users want reliable app to move apps to SD card though there are many good root apps on Google Play to do that job but wait don&#8217;t rush there is one reliable feature rich app named Scene5 which is not available on Google Play but can do alot of system customization on Android including move apps to SD card though it&#8217;s actually made for Mediatek processor smartphones but it also work on Qualcomm Snapdragon ones with support for latest Android versions but note kindly don&#8217;t mess with certain things on Scene5 without knowledge as it can either hard or softbrick Android device which is likely fixable but sometimes irreparable, so do you like it? are you still interested? If yes let&#8217;s explore more.</p>

<p>Overall, Scene5 comes with light and dark mode by default, it has clean and simple intuitive interface that ensures user friendly experience, but in any project there is always space for improvement so let&#8217;s wait and see will Scene5 get any major UI changes in future to make it even more better, as of now it&#8217;s awesome.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is definitely worth to mention Scene5 is one of the very root apps available out there on world wide web of internet that move your apps to SD card without format including that the main benefit of Scene5 is it support latest Android versions as well, yes indeed if you are searching for such app then it has potential to become your new favorite.</p>
<p>Finally, this is how you can move apps to SD card on rooted Android devices using Scene5 but always be careful when doing anything to stay in safe zone, are you an existing user of Scene5? If yes do say your experience and mention if you know any way better app than Scene5 in our comment section below, see ya 🙂</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/flowdor-a-super-cool-substratum-theme-for-android-custom-roms.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/flowdor-a-super-cool-substratum-theme-for-android-custom-roms.webp" width="400" alt="flowdor-a-super-cool-substratum-theme-for-android-custom-roms"></a></p>
<p>Interface is basically something it can be either physical or virtual by using that you can access or connect to something like  display screens and operating systems inshort OS which we use on electronic devices like PCs and smartphones are basically interfaces they let you execute certain tasks electronically and digitally due to such functionality of interface it&#8217;s  quite essential and important thing as without that you can&#8217;t access or connect anything thanks to that demand for better interfaces is always existed in market and to supply them many makers around the world created a lot of different types of useful amazing interfaces for various purposes out of them you have to choose right one according to the needs carefully so that you can do things effectively.</p>
<p>Eventhough, there are many types of interfaces but when it comes to electronic devices operating system is basically software created using programming languages like C, C++, Java, Python etc is considered as digital interface with that only you will be able to access and use hardware and software technologies efficiently at first in begginings electronic devices like PCs used to come with cmd aka command line interface which is not easy one in order to use that you have to send commands using keyboard for each and everything but eventually thanks to inventors by year 1980s we got to see GUI aka graphical user interface that comes with layout and let you use system using mouse cursor, isn&#8217;t that fabulous?</p>
<p>In 21st century modern world of digital technologies we widely use GUI based  operating systems on almost all electronic devices at first in early era of GUIs we used to have simple ones but now we have modern ones thought most of them are super cool but thing is if you don&#8217;t like the one you are using on your device then if system allows you can simply switch to different supported OS that has better GUI design and characteristics you like and prefer to use but the problem here is whenever you want to switch OS you have to go through certain process each and everytime including that if your device doesn&#8217;t let you or don&#8217;t support different operating systems then it is a setback and it&#8217;ll be difficult for sure, isn&#8217;t that right?</p>
<p>Especially, if you&#8217;re someone who can&#8217;t or don&#8217;t want to switch to some other OS but still want different GUI then it&#8217;s way more hard and difficult task as this time you have to manually change necessary inbuild system files to change GUI but thing is in order to do all this first your device system must allow and you have to be an skilled developer with understanding on structure of OS on which you may have to replace, change, modify system files to get desired GUI output or else you may mess up system files that may break device which is sometimes irreparable thought PCs and most of it&#8217;s operating systems allow you to change anything internally without limits but when it comes to smartphone operating systems there are limits and voids device warranty.</p>
<p>In sense, on PC operating systems you&#8217;ll get both read and write access in system partitions with just few clicks you can enable superadminstator to run or use it almost everywhere but when it comes to smartphone operating systems like for instance on Android which is popular foss aka free and open source software has more than 70% worldwide market share developed by search engine giant Google on that by default you&#8217;ll get read access but in order to get write access on system partitions you have to unlock bootloader and install rooting software like SuperSu or Magisk at the end PC or smartphone changing inbuild OS GUI is hard task but don&#8217;t worry even if you&#8217;re not geek you can  still change GUI for that there are number of softwares to amaze you on the go.</p>
<p>Nowadays, most people around the world widely using smartphones over PCs as they are easily movable handheld devices including that they can do almost all tasks of PCs in their own way efficiently if you are someone who use smartphone and wanna change inbuild GUI of OS then you are at right place at first back in early versions of Android we used to don&#8217;t have inbuild or external universal softwares to change inbuild GUI of stock roms thought we can find many for custom roms like CyanogenMod at the end they are not and won&#8217;t work on stock ones but eventually in later versions of Android OS like 6.0 and above we got to see few external super cool universal softwares to change GUI of stock and custom Android roms which are known as custom theming engines out of them Substratum seems like worthy one.</p>
<p>You may probably know when you use pure stock Android OS you won&#8217;t get any inbuilt theming engines as Google don&#8217;t provide them but when you use custom OEM Android roms like MiUI, HiOS, FIUI, EMUI etc or custom roms you&#8217;ll get one or more amazing theming engines with a lot of magnificent themes which can be bit disappointing if you&#8217;re an stock Android user as you have to stick to same existing inbuilt UI for long time but don&#8217;t worry as there is demand for softwares to change GUI on stock Android OS number of third party developers back in year 2016 made theming engine named Substratum which is now the top and most popular one that has thousands of custom themes to apply custom overlays on stock Android as well as some oem specific roms but to make it work well you better to do all this thing on your rooted Android device, gotcha?</p>
<p>Eventhough, Substratum can apply custom overlays on non rooted Android 8.0 oreo devices but for that you have to use PC and enable Andromeda which work on all smartphones except Samsung for that you need synergy at the end anyhow Google preventing stock Android users from using custom overlays due to that Substratum and most of it&#8217;s custom themes support Android 10 Q and below versions thought there are some subtratum themes which support new Android versions but thing is if you&#8217;re an avid substratum user then you may probably already used them or want better one right? in that case recently we got to know about one underated feature rich beautiful custom overlays Substratum theme named Flowdor that you may never heard off as it&#8217;s not available on play store but it&#8217;s assuring and super impressive for sure, so do you like it? are you interested in Flowdor?

					<description><![CDATA[Battery life is something that most people are concerned isn&#8217;t it? the [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/acc-a-module-to-control-charging-on-rooted-android-devices.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/acc-a-module-to-control-charging-on-rooted-android-devices.webp" alt="acc-a-module-to-control-charging-on-rooted-android-devices" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>Battery life is something that most people are concerned isn&#8217;t it? the more battery life or you may say juice you can get the more you can use device as battery is the main and essential component of any devices that powerup all hardware and software units without that you can&#8217;t utilize them which is why it&#8217;s important to select right battery thought there are numerous types of batteries out of them silicon and lithium are popular ones but thing is silicon is old one so most people at present to powerup devices using lithium batteries thought it does have drawbacks like when you over charge or use a lot overtime it generates heat and lose it&#8217;s current storage capacity yet still at the end lithium based batteries are modern and cheap to use on the go.</p>
<p>In sense, lithium batteries are way better then silicon batteries not just interms of technologies used but also overall price of produce in comparison to silicon batteries which is why most makers like and prefer to use lithium batteries on most electronic devices like to name few laptops, mobiles, powerbanks, smartphones etc what not on almost all electronic devices but in the end whatever battery you use on device it must have power else device won&#8217;t work though there are several ways to powerup battery out of them electricity is most widely used one in homes and companies etc which is available in 2 forms direct aka DC and AC aka alternate current but modern devices usually don&#8217;t support AC as it has current fluctuations so we convert AC current to DC using devices like smps aka switched mode power supply, interesting right?</p>
<p>There are numerous ways to generate electricity at the end in order to pass it on electronic devices most makers usually Integrate with smps or such technologies to convert electricity&#8217;s AC to DC current so that there will no fluctuations and device can be powered up consistently but you can&#8217;t simply pass AC or DC current on to electronic device wirelessly unless you&#8217;re using Tesla coil made by great scientist Nikola Tesla which is unfinished so at present you may have to use cable as mediator to pass AC or DC current from electricty resource to your device as you may know another great businessman and scientist Thomas Edison commercialized electricity extensively thanks to him now most places are electrified so all you have to do is connect device to electric source it can power up battery quite instantly.</p>
<p>However, if you don&#8217;t have electricity then try to make or find it carefully if you have it then as said earlier you must have to use cable with device like smps as mediator between electricity resource to pass AC or DC current to electronic device but you can&#8217;t use whatever cable or smps device they have to support and handle current well and properly else it can put powering up battery and device into many troubles because when you connect device to an AC or DC current electric power source it has to get right amount of it if exceeded it has to be somehow controlled by device using smps or any other technologies else it may damage device completely to not let it happen we got device charger which not only convert AC to DC current but also it comes with particular voltage capacity based on that it supplies power to devices at the same time it stop over power supply to keep connected devices in safe zone.</p>
<p>In simple, charger is basically essential electronic device without that you can&#8217;t power up electronic devices easily as charger with it&#8217;s hardware even software technologies work as mediator to recieve and control flow of electricity and convert AC to DC current then based on it&#8217;s voltage capacity passes it on to electronic device that may seems simple but mechanisms of charger is quite fantastic at first in the beginning era chargers are less capable with low voltage capacity as at that time most batteries used to come with less mah aka milliampere capacity but as time goes we got big mah capacity batteries due to that a lot of people demanded for fast chargers and demand for them in market increased exponentially thanks to that most makers started integrating many technologies and increasing voltage capacity of chargers in that process we got the fast chargers.</p>
<p>Fast chargers are way better than regular chargers they over the years rapidly gone through continous developements from many makers worldwide in that process eventually now we got super powerful and advanced fast chargers with huge voltage capacity and amazing technologies they can charge big battery in just few minutes quickly but the drawback of fast chargers is you can only use them on such devices which also support them due to the fact many makers developing various different fast charging technologies and integrating them in hardware and software of devices since long time which are cool though fast charging is absolutely life saver and useful in most scenarios but fast charging on the lithium batteries is not good idea because it not only heat and damage but over time also reduces battery capacity which is why experts recommend to always slow charge for long time usage, safety and well-being of your lithium batteries, are you aware?</p>
<p>Eventhough, there are many electronic devices yet still out of them most people widely use are handheld smartphones powered by Google&#8217;s Android operating system as it&#8217;s foss aka free and open source operating system and flexible though most latest Android smartphones based mainly on device processor and other number of specifications usually comes with inbuild modern fast charging technologies like to name few Qualcomm&#8217;s Quick, Mediatek&#8217;s Pump Express and then comes device based ones like IC, flash and vooc etc they usually comes with protection and support for high voltage fast chargers but thing is experts still recommend not to charge devices with fast chargers instead use low voltage slow chargers at the end you use regular or fast chargers when you over charge battery like more then 80% or even drop it below 20% and charge overnight or long hours of time can negatively effect battery life for sure.</p>
<p>Usually, most users power up devices using fast chargers overnight or long time but as said earlier doing that even with slow low voltage chargers will gradually damage and reduce battery life so experts recommend not to do such acts but thing is due to whatever reasons for a lot of people it&#8217;s not always possible to stay attentive to charging percentage and not charge device battery overnight right? are you one of them like you may only get time to charge battery at night or you are such person who due to work or schedule won&#8217;t be able to check device battery percentage timely etc so at the end you may thought when device reach certain battery level you want to stop charging automatically so that you don&#8217;t have to worry about the overcharge of battery right? but problem here is not only Android many other os smartphones don&#8217;t stop charging until you manually disconnect charger from your smartphone, isn&#8217;t that disappointing?</p>
<p>However, in order to stop charging device battery you not always have to manually disconnect charger all you have to do is make some tweaks in system software of smartphone it will automatically not only stop even control temperature and slow down device charging time extremely like 1% in 1 hour or days isn&#8217;t that awesome? at present AndroidOS has more than 70% market share globally yet still even on the latest AndroidOS doesn&#8217;t provide an option to stop or slowdown charging on devices but don&#8217;t worry Android device users can unlock bootloader and install one rooting software like SuperSu which is old one or modern systemless Magisk to get access to system partition aka root access where you can change, replace, modify necessary files to stop or slowdown charging quite automatically but in order to do this things you must be skilled developer or geek who have understanding of Android structure or else you may hard or softbrick device which is sometimes totally irreparable.</p>
<p>Especially, rooting Android and modifying system partition on smartphones voids device warranty unless you live in EU aka European Union if you aware of that still want to or already rooted your Android device and now looking forward to control charging then you&#8217;re at right place, usually in order to control charging at software level of Android smartphones you need to be skilled developer but if you want to control charging at hardware level then you have to be skilled technician but don&#8217;t worry even if you are neither of them still you can auto control charging on Android smartphones using certain rooted apps made by third party developers thought there are many of them to do this job out of them we recently got to know about an pretty good app named ACC aka advanced charging control by using that on Android you can control charging productively.</p>
<p>ACC aka advanced charging control is simple solution developed by VR-25 intended to control charging and extend battery life service on rooted Android devices effectively which manipulates Android low level kernel parameters to control charging circuitry thought in most cases you won&#8217;t get problem but if you do neither we or ACC take responsibility so try at your own risk before you install ACC on your Android device make sure to read <a href="https://github.com/VR-25/acc#frequently-asked-questions-faq" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">FAQ</a> aka frequently asked questions and proceed further gotcha? currently ACC is available as command line interface and graphical user interface which is known as ACCA so use whichever is convenient and comfortable for you at the end there are many versions of ACC out of them latest ones may have bugs so we are going to view old and stable 6.13 version of ACC which seems better and provide everything in simple manner, so do you like it? are you interested? If yes let&#8217;s explore more.</p>
