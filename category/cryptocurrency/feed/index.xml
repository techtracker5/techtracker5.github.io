										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pepe-a-meme-frog-named-web3-nft-crypto-domains-from-cortex.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pepe-a-meme-frog-named-web3-nft-crypto-domains-from-cortex.webp" alt="pepe-a-meme-frog-named-web3-nft-crypto-domains-from-cortex" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>Time is super valuable thing once it passed you can&#8217;t go back unless you have working time machine which is why if you got opportunity to experience something that you wish or like it&#8217;s better to do as you may not get same in future because in this world most things changing and evolving at fast pace if you miss to grab certain things then you may regret later but yeah there are certain things which may come back if large percentage of people want and insist like old trends, technologies and products etc so that even if you missed them you can experience back now or in the future, isn&#8217;t that pretty awesome?</p>
<p>We gone through many era&#8217;s right? and in each and every era we got to see many interesting and amazing trends, products and technologies though you may already seen or got them back then or now as many of them are still going on thanks to society but there are many things which are lost thought some people for various reasons still have or follow them mainly to remember past memories and bring back old glory but fact is they are not available in widescale anymore if you are someone who for whatever reasons haven&#8217;t seen or got them back then it&#8217;s something that you may have regret or disappointed for sure.</p>
<p>Even if there are old trends, products and technologies which are now not available in widescale that doesn&#8217;t mean they will be not available forever as said earlier if you and large percentage of society around the world insist and want those back then they will start again so that you can feel wanted vibes that you wished to enjoy for some or long time but not everything people want to refeel and bring back which are limited to some things if what you wanted is in the high demand list then most likely you are going to experience them soon as a lot of people already in line and as there is huge demand many companies for commercial reasons do so much work and spend a lot of money to make and provide the things that people wanted around the world.</p>
<p>There are many things which were eventually changed and evolved over time that large percentage want to bring back but the one that we are now going to specifically talk about is pepe the frog which is basically a cartoon character designed as an green anthropomorphic frog with a humanoid body orginated in Furie&#8217;s 2005 comic <i>Boy&#8217;s Club</i> created by Matt Furie that became quite popular and internet meme back in year 2008 on several social platforms like 4chan, Tumblr, Gaia etc thought pepe the frog memes trend continued for number of years at peak level in that time we got to see numerous different variations of pepe the frog memes like sad frog, feels frog, smug frog, angry frog etc to suit different types of need and emotions, cool right?</p>
<p>Pepe, the frog in just few years got immense popularity and usage around the world it&#8217;s figure used in various ways for different purposes it was even used by some groups in number of political events like in protests and campaigns etc thanks to all euphoria surrounded around pepe the frog there is even documentary made on it named feels good man including that there are large number of people and fanbase who highly like and want to use things developed on pepe the frog theme as there is huge demand to supply for commercial reasons many companies over the years created different types of cool and valuable physical and digital products, services etc.</p>
<p>But thing is like most old trends as time passes eventually pepe the frog popularity and usage is reduced little day by day due to the different reasons mainly as part of change and to try something new a lot of people switched to new trends and started using them forgetting about pepe the frog to follow latest trends and stay updated in this evolving world thought some people still remember and use pepe the frog but as it&#8217;s old trend most people mainly gen z are unaware of pepe the frog which is old trend but good one so many people even gen z&#8217;s who recently got to know about it want to experience pepe the frog trend at peak level which people back in early 20th century very fortunate to see on live.</p>
<p>Eventhough, there is activity going on pepe the frog thanks to some people who still creating and using pepe the frog memes, products and services as at present it&#8217;s usage and availabilty is limited you may say it&#8217;s not possible to see pepe the frog trend at peak level but thing is in order to fill a ocean first drop of rain is essential after that only remaining drops will follow likewise until or unless you start or take part in the existing trend even if it&#8217;s small then now or soon that trend whichever you participated may form shape and become quite big in upcoming days that&#8217;s why if you really want to experience pepe the frog trend at peak level then in one way or another in whichever possible way try to promote or indulge into things related to it wherever possible on the go globally.</p>
<p>We already have some things developed based on theme pepe the frog out of them the most interesting and innovative thing based on new technology is pepe crypto currency coin aka token which all mainly pepe coin increasing pepe the frog trend day by day paving way to make big trend as soon as possible but thing is pepe coin is crypto currency so a lot of people are not aware of it except active crypto market researchers and investors so until pepe the frog get into thing which is liked and used by large percentage of people like memes else it&#8217;s bit hard and difficult to reach peak level at present pepe the frog memes is not up to level in comparison to other memes so there has to be some way better alternative to the pepe coin that can rise trend pepe the frog effectively.</p>
<p>Crypto is basically revolutionary decentralized digital currency first developed and released by pseudonymous Satoshi nakamoto named Bitcoin back in year 2009 which price just like stocks is volatile based on buy and sell in market at first Bitcoin doesn&#8217;t have much value but because of founder focus on organic reach eventually Bitcoin attracted investors worldwide including that it inspired many developers who developed a lot of crypto tokens thought Bitcoin is long time crypto market leader even now but other crypto tokens are also widely used around the world like for instance Ethereum, Tether, Binance and USDC etc at the end crypto became best alternative to fiat currency and considered as valuable assets like stocks around the world.</p>
<p>Bitcoin came into existence mainly to replace untrustworthy middlemans like banks by providing better security using encryptions and memephrase key based crypto wallets, privacy as it doesn&#8217;t need personal data and mainly transparency using blockchain explorers with total ownership of money though banks says they will provide them but not up to the level of Bitcoin and other crypto tokens because banks usually ask and require your personal details which they can use as they like even share to third parties with or without consent or permission of you and they store money deposited in lockers thought they are very secure with the latest secure technologies but as they are centralized thief&#8217;s are able to somehow compromise them and mainly banks are not transparent they will usually don&#8217;t show where and how they are using your personal details and money including that they usually never show technologies used to protect them and customer money which is why a lot of people don&#8217;t want to use bank system instead like and prefer to use and invest in crypto currencies.</p>
<p>Especially, when it comes to secure transactions Bitcoin and other crypto tokens are way ahead of banks as crypto tokens use proof of stake system first implemented by Bitcoin in which once user send money to any unique wallet address it will be verified by number of users who are known as miners by resolving blocks of algorithms using 1 or more computer for that they&#8217;ll receive some crypto tokens as reward due to all this process whatever transactions done by users will be genuine and secure thus no one can do frauds and illegal activities including that transactions for transparency will be recorded publicly in blockchain explorer which is different in banks where they use centralized system to approve all transactions and they never usually share transactions of users in any manner publicly with user IDs which is not always right system to follow that&#8217;s why since last decade crypto tokens getting popularity and widely used worldwide.</p>
<p>Eventhough, crypto tokens and it&#8217;s technologies have potential to replace banks and fiat currency and users of crypto tokens growing everyday yet most people still use banks and fiat currency because crypto currencies usage is not fully legal and approved by almost all countries except permission to use if added national identity card to purchase or do transactions using crypto wallet or on CEX aka centralized crypto exchange platforms with some regulations for taxes on buying and selling of crypto tokens so just with one $pepe crypto token it&#8217;s not possible to see pepe the frog at massive level for that as said earlier there has to be something that is highly used by almost all people around the world like for instance domains without them we not even able to access internet to check websites, blogs, files etc that&#8217;s why if we got pepe domains they may work better than pepe memes.</p>
<p>Internet is basically network of computers which are interconnected to eachother using an standard protocol known as IP created by ARPANET back in year 1960s first used to send messages between computers after that it gone through many advancements due to that it eventually become better secure and modern one but thing is till the end of 1980s internet used to be private one due to that only approved users are able to access them but later on in year 1991 inventor named Tim Berners Lee developed an software named WWW aka world wide web known as browser by using that anyone can access public data available on internet with url aka uniform resource locater aka link or aka domain or web or domain address so many people around the world who want to show their data online started creating websites and blogs etc using computer and then started publishing on internet due to that internet in just few years become quite big one.</p>
<p>Now, we have millions of websites and blogs on internet which are build using web development programming languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python etc and hosted utilizing many technologies mainly storage and memory available on personal computers and dedicated cloud servers but in order to publish and access website or blog using browser we need domain thought once you create server you will automatically get low level numerical unique domain address like for example : 01.56.254.230 as computer convert and understand every input in numbers binary format but thing is most people used to alphabetical names so to get them there are many paid and free domain name registrars where you can choose and register any available domain names with extensions you like for months or years then connect to your website or blog to publish on internet instantly.</p>
<p>There are many domain name registrars like GoDaddy, BigRock etc who provide many amazing features mainly dns aka domain name servers by using them you can connect domain to your websites or blogs which basically resolve numerical web address into name but the problem here with domain name registrars is they are centralized owned by one or more companies where users usually have to provide many personal details to register domains and you have to register domain name every year including that you will not get full ownership on domains they can be controlled by domain name registrars as they like anytime including that if domain violates rules like for illegal activities their details and IP address can be traced by law enforcement agencies to take legal actions or can be blocked either by DMCA or ISP or country firewall which are some things that a lot of people don&#8217;t like about domain names, are you one of them?</p>
<p>In Web 1.0 and now in 2.0 era we widely using centralized domains but they have number of drawbacks so to fix them we eventually upgrading to Web3.0 which is basically decentralization of internet where we are going to replace centralized domains and servers with decentralized Web3 ones that provides several benefits like to name few they are super value for money as Web3 domains are based on crypto technology with only one time purchase and no renew fees, privacy as they don&#8217;t need user details to get access to services, security and ownership using crypto encryptions and proof of stake system with memephrase crypto wallets, transparency as crypto technologies and transactions will be in public domain on blockchain explorers, amazing right?</p>
<p>In sense, to be clear Web3 domains uses blockchain which are non-fungible tokens in short NFTs each and every NFT is unique with it&#8217;s own digital signature that cannot be duplicated due to that they&#8217;re considered rare and valuable assets and collectables when you get NFT domain from Web3 platforms you will not get ip address instead you will get an alphabetic crypto wallet address which is resolved to domain name using decentralized domain name server inshort ddns after that you can only connect Web3 domains to Web3 servers using IPFS aka interplanetary file system not on Web2 content management systems like Blogger, WordPress, Medium etc at present they are not supported but as part of evolution most cms platforms may use IPFS Web3 servers and add the support for Web3 domains in future.</p>
<p>Web3 domains are connected to IPFS decentralized servers aka nodes when you use them your data will be divided into numerous parts and get encrypted and hosted on number of servers provided by users or companies due to that it&#8217;s super hard even impossible for anyone to exploit and hack your data including that data is hosted on numerous servers around the world so even if one server went down another will be there thus you will mostly get 24/7 hours uptime including that it makes them censorship resistant no one even law enforcement agencies can&#8217;t take or block them thanks to such potential many people who want trustable security and anonymity gradually getting into Web3 domains and servers, so if there is .pepe web3 nft domains they not only level up pepe the frog trend but also makes trend future proof for sure, don&#8217;t you think?</p>
<p>Currently, platforms which provide web3 domains are less out of them most don&#8217;t provide .pepe domains but recently we got to know about Web3 domain provider named Cortex and Butterfly protocol who currently sells .ape limited edition web3 domains and .hmn free Web3 domains and now they are promoting and selling 10x less expensive unlimited .pepe for people who want pepe the frog things which is based on Ethereum network with build in ens aka Ethereum name servers once you get .pepe web3 domain you can mint sub domains by paying transaction aka gas fees which all you can simply connect to cortex press a highly scalable Web3 decentralized content management system to simply publish and manage Web3 content easily on the go.</p>
<p>.Pepe is considered as TLD aka top level web3 domains which has many more benefits to name few each and every .pepe site work as crypto wallet with it&#8217;s own erc20 wallet address and by utilizing integration of charged particles tecnology you can store ERC-20s, 1155s, and 721s inside including that you can simply edit metadata of domain or subdomain to add your own art, music and files etc, so do you like it? are you interested in .pepe domains? If yes let&#8217;s explore more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rola-ai-web3-0-crypto-community-with-rewards-and-personal-nfts.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rola-ai-web3-0-crypto-community-with-rewards-and-personal-nfts.webp" width="400" alt="rola-ai-web3-0-crypto-community-with-rewards-and-personal-nfts"></a></p>
<p>Now a days, we frequently use internet to know any type of information but have you ever thought what exactly is internet? It is created by ARPANET back in year 1969 is an standard protocol build for electric and electronic computers to move data on an network which provide unique IP address to each computer for identity at first IP is primarily used to send messages between two computers after that it gone through alot of improvements and updates due to that the usages of IP extended but as it&#8217;s private require manual access everytime.</p>
<p>There are three types of computers, founder Charles Babbage in early 18th century created hardware based mechanical parts machine without electricity but in mid 19th century inventors and companies build electric and electronic computers then upgraded them to integrate operating system basically software that can install more softwares which are developed using various programming languages after that in 20th century we got keypad mobile phones and smartphones that can also install softwares and do almost all real life physical action tasks electronically and digitally same as computers.</p>
</p>
<p>Anyhow, fortunately In year 1991 Tim Berners Lee created and released an revolutionary software named WWW aka world wide web browser that can access public contents of internet which are in digital form accessible on computers due to that it recieved huge attention and recognition from people around the world who created various useful digital platforms in form of websites and blogs on thier computer and created an server using RAM aka system memory to host them on Internet.</p>
<p>However, computers back in Web 1.0 are not powerful enough they have basic hardware and software that was only capable to create and store less size digital platforms even RAM also only able to handle few hundred visitors due to that companies to supply demand of users for personal or commercial reasons by web 2.0 era started in early 20th century begin selling poweful computers so alot of people created big size modern digital platforms using various programming languages but they are quite expensive so not everyone can afford them.</p>
<p>Thankfully, since the beginning of internet many developers and companies created cloud hosting platforms which in back end use hardware to provide the storage and ram but you can&#8217;t see them instead you will get them in digital form with flexible plans and plenty of options and features where you have to register with details for verification and login purposes then setup to host all your websites and blogs.</p>
<p>Even though, cloud hosting platforms are way more convenient and comfortable to host digital platforms then computers as they can be accessible on any supported electronic device like computer but the problem here is they rely on centralized servers as they use only single server to protect private credentials and data of digital platforms due to that black hat hackers primarly target and exploit them via loop holes to gain access and delete or extract personal data for illegal means like publishing online or selling on darkweb etc which is why we&#8217;re upgrading to Web 3.0.</p>
<p>Web3.0 is future of internet where digital platforms use many decentralized servers known as nodes provided by company or individuals around the world thus they are not only censorship resistant and stay always uptime but also provide military grade security thus it&#8217;s near to impossible for anyone to hack them including that Web3 is also about decentralization of all types of digital softwares.</p>
<p>On January 3, 2009 Satoshi Nakamoto an anonymous person may be inspired by Web3 concept created and released decentralized digital crypto currency that provide privacy using crypto wallet where you don&#8217;t have to submit any personal details and security with it&#8217;s proof of stake system where miners using computer power solve crypto algorithm blocks to authenticate and verify transactions thus it&#8217;s fraud proof and then transparency using Blockchain explorer where crypto wallet total value and transactions shown in real time publicly, amazing isn&#8217;t?</p>
<p>Bitcoin is revolutionary crypto currency at first Satoshi Nakamoto want organic growth so didn&#8217;t done any advertising and promotions but later on with in few years Bitcoin gained alot of loyal and new investors with fame globally due to that it eventually become world&#8217;s most popular and valuable crypto currency after that many developers and companies created thier own crypto currency using different technologies similar to Bitcoin but with new features by adapting to latest crypto technologies accordingly like Ethereum, Polygon, Tron, Kusuma, Polkodot etc.</p>
<p>Now we have numerous crypto currencies with millions of tokens known as non fungible token which rely on network chain of particular open source crypto currency and they are rapidly progressing by extensively using Web3 decentralized concept for Instance from past few years many developers and companies created and integrated dApps aka decentralized apps into crypto currency wallets by using them manage crypto currency assets efficiently and do more then before.</p>
<p>But, majority of people don&#8217;t know about Web3 as it&#8217;s not available in full scale even if they want to know or already have knowledge on Web3 crypto currencies still most of them didn&#8217;t joined any Web3 crypto communities available on social media networks even if they joined yet most probably almost all of them only discuss about particular crypto currency not all Web3 crypto currencies including that they don&#8217;t provide any rewards thus the interest to stay active and help others without any profit is quite boring isn&#8217;t?</p>
<p>In case, you don&#8217;t know about social media networks which are basically digital platforms available as websites and softwares for computers and smartphones etc at first in beginnings social media networks are basic in CLI aka command line interface and TUI aka text based interface that are not easy to use unless you&#8217;re programmer but after the entry of world wide web we started getting user friendly GUI aka graphical user Interface poweful and advanced modern social media networks which provide amazing features using various latest technologies.</p>
<p>In 21st century, we have modern social media networks on them you can send unlimited digital messages and files, make live audio and video calls to individuals or groups, create channels to broadcast content and groups with alot of members to chat with community where you can not only chat but also share digital stuff and get likes or comments etc which is now global advanced way of communication widely used by people conveniently.</p>
<p>Recently, we found an app named ROLA.ai which is an AI aka articifical intelligence based Web3 crypto currency social media networks for Web3 crypto enthusiasts and supporters where you can do crypto currency predictions and get crypto rewards including that it creates personal NFT using sentinel analysis with Social-fi and games as bonus for joyful community, so do you like it? are you interested in ROLA.ai?

					<description><![CDATA[We&#8217;ve been using fiat currency form of money made out of paper [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/what-are-crypto-currency-scams-and-how-to-stay-away-from-them.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/what-are-crypto-currency-scams-and-how-to-stay-away-from-them.webp" alt="what-are-crypto-currency-scams-and-how-to-stay-away-from-them" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been using fiat currency form of money made out of paper extensively to buy any type of goods and products it&#8217;s orgin dates back to 11th century when china used fiat money notes then after long time in early 18th century of modern government United States of America government started printing fiat currency with it&#8217;s own symbol and value according to economy and gold reserves then said people to consider it as money.</p>
<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/1_what-are-crypto-currency-scams-and-how-to-stay-away-from-them.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/1_what-are-crypto-currency-scams-and-how-to-stay-away-from-them.webp" alt="1_what-are-crypto-currency-scams-and-how-to-stay-away-from-them" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>Fiat currency is thin and easy to use due to its flexibility at first many people used to don&#8217;t believe in it but eventually as there is no choice almost everyone begin using fiat currency in America after that one by one numerous countries governments started printing thier own fiat currency following america due to that eventually in just few years people around the world shifted to fiat currency to make or receive payments prior that humans depended on ancient times barter system, gold, daimonds etc.</p>
<p>Anyhow, money in any form that you own should be in safe place else it can snatched by thief&#8217;s in beginnings people used to store thier money with themselves or in home then later we got much better security systems came in place known as banks which employs professionals to protect your money at first they used to store only gold and daimonds but later on due to demand from people globally and intervention of governments banks begin accepting fiat currency as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2_what-are-crypto-currency-scams-and-how-to-stay-away-from-them.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2_what-are-crypto-currency-scams-and-how-to-stay-away-from-them.webp" alt="2_what-are-crypto-currency-scams-and-how-to-stay-away-from-them" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>Banks either owned by country government or private companies gone through alot of improvements especially since the entry of fiat currency by fixing existing loop holes and adapting to new technologies due to that we got modern banks which provide ATMs and digital services through internet on world wide web accessible on computer since year1991 by using them you can manage or send and receive money easily around the world electronically and digitally.</p>
<p>Even though, In mid 19th century banks have way more secure methods and technologies to protect your money that was even further extended over the years still criminals using various techniques to snatch from banks including that banks require all your personal details and don&#8217;t provide transparency on how they work and store or use your money that can cause privacy and security concerns.</p>
<p>Especially, the lack of transparency in banks making them to commit frauds and scams like illegally robbing your money then escaping to another country by bank founder or it&#8217;s employees or by providing your money in big numbers more then the it&#8217;s bank capacity to rich people for high interests then unable to recovery them due to that many people lost money globally.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Almost all countries governments for people developed and introduced number of laws and policies for banks to restrict them from committing any types of scams or banks but still they are able to do mainly small banks even if you have banks that don&#8217;t do any illegal activities still they lack transparency so at the end you may always can&#8217;t trust banks.</p>
<p>In year 2009, on January 3 Satoshi Nakamoto an anonymous person released decentralized digital crypto currency named Bitcoin that uses Web3 concept of internet to replace fiat currency and untrustworthy centralized mediators like banks to provide privacy using it&#8217;s crypto wallets that don&#8217;t require any personal details to store Bitcoin like name, email, address etc isn&#8217;t amazing?</p>
<p>In terms of security Bitcoin using it&#8217;s proof of stake system where all your Bitcoin transactions are checked and verified by numerous miners using computer power by solving algorithm blocks thus it&#8217;s fraud proof including that transparency via Blockchain explorer over there you can find any Bitcoin wallet address total value and transactions are recorded and shown in real time publicly for anyone.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is revolutionary decentralised crypto currency which price is not decided and fixed instead it&#8217;s volatile as it depends on buy and sells at first Bitcoin didn&#8217;t got much audience as founder wanted organic growth without advertisements and partnerships etc that helped to gain loyal investors and with in few years Bitcoin got huge attention and recognition from people around the world due to that it eventually become most valuable crypto currency.</p>
<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/3_what-are-crypto-currency-scams-and-how-to-stay-away-from-them.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/3_what-are-crypto-currency-scams-and-how-to-stay-away-from-them.webp" alt="3_what-are-crypto-currency-scams-and-how-to-stay-away-from-them" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>Fortunately, many developers and companies inspired by Bitcoin created thier own crypto currency for Instance Vitalik Buterin created Ethereum with it&#8217;s own open source network in year 2013 that later on got #2 spot most valuable crypto currency next to Bitcoin despite it&#8217;s high fees scalability issues after that we got alot of crypto currencies adapting to new technologies and millions of tokens created using existing crypto networks by individuals or teams and companies etc for personal or commercial purposes.</p>
<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/4_what-are-crypto-currency-scams-and-how-to-stay-away-from-them.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/4_what-are-crypto-currency-scams-and-how-to-stay-away-from-them.webp" alt="4_what-are-crypto-currency-scams-and-how-to-stay-away-from-them" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>In sense, crypto currencies are advanced and powerful with potential and capability to totally replace fiat currency in future due to that several countries already accepted crypto currency as legal money including that it has huge demand and craze globally which is why crypto companies and enthusiastics mainly from past years in the process of upgrading Internet to Web3 created many external crypto decentralized digital platforms Integrated in crypto wallets known as dApps like decentralized finances and exchanges etc to manage your crypto currencies more efficiently.</p>
<p>dApps simplified the usage of crypto currencies by providing alot of new options and features which not only allow to manage your crypto currencies convieniently and comfortably but also further extends security and privacy with transparency because of that alot of new people especially millennials and Gen-z investing in crypto currencies.</p>
<p>However, just like banks even in crypto currencies there are scams usually done by official crypto currency founders and developers themelves or third party individuals or unregistered unknown companies who find and use various methods and ways on world wide web of internet to trick and trap you into thier crypto scams and frauds if you by chance entered in thier boon then you will surely loose all your crypto currencies.</p>
<p>Generally, you won&#8217;t find scams and frauds from top crypto currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum etc which are been there for atleast decade but from past few years everyone able to create crypto currencies for 1 to 3$ due to that millions of new NFT aka non fungible tokens getting into crypto market every day out of them mainly large number of new ones like 1 day or month old are fake created by scammers who has no long time goals but attracts you to buy thier NFTs with promotions then once they get enough buyers they most likely close it or swap them using same NFTs that they personally stored in private not publicly supplied to other popular crypto currencies due to that value will become 0 and you will lose money which may go on until scammer decided to stop this.</p>
<p>There are different types of crypto scams and frauds out of them main one is fake smartchain crypto currency platforms where they ask you to invest thier own or any other popular crypto currencies to buy plans like basic, pro or expert etc once you done that they will show you levels when you upgrade or invite more people into thier fake smartchain network they will say to provide reward commission or increase your daily or monthly earnings with level ups based on thier pre-shown time line but they will not instead once you send crypto currency tokens to them they simply don&#8217;t reply and give anything due to that all your and refferals who invested money in it will be totally wasted for sure.</p>
<p>It is bit hard to determine which is geniune and fake investment and refferal based smartchain crypto currency earning platforms as the fake looks more genuine then genuine one itself for Instance fake ones usually hire top customer service employs then design thier websites and other digital platforms with experts to attract you in first glimpse then convince you by replying all your questions sweetly in start until you invest in them after that like always backstab you without replying to your questions by that time you&#8217;ll know you got scammed smartly.</p>
<p>But, we have few ways to identify such fake smartchain platforms foremost search on web regarding that platform which you want to use if you found people even in few members says it&#8217;s scam don&#8217;t invest it after that check it&#8217;s offers if they provide huge return for small investments then for sure it&#8217;s scam as normally most genuine ones don&#8217;t provide high returns for small tiny investments as it&#8217;s not possible so kindly stay away from them infinitely.</p>
<p>Now, usually if you&#8217;re into crypto currency investments then you may probably know there are many crypto currency wallets and exchanges like stocks as both have similar characteristics right? In case of crypto currency we have both centralised and decentralized crypto currency wallets and exchanges out of them majority are genuine but few of them are totally fake created and released by scammers with spyware that take screenshots secretly or in back end transfer your crypto currencies to some unknown crypto currency wallet address without your permission which is why it is always better to use trusted and well known reliable crypto currency wallet and exchanges from trusted sources else you&#8217;ll end up got vanishing everything.</p>
<p>The next crypto scam that most crypto currency investors especially new ones face is with fake crypto air drops you may very likely partnered or joined in them already isn&#8217;t? If yes or not to be clear not all crypto air drops are fake alot of them are genuine provided by founders of crypto currency for limited period of time like few days or months until they reach thier goal when you register in them you have to pay little transaction fee based on crypto network after that automatically you will get crypto tokens of that airdrop instantly or after the end which may have more value that&#8217;s fine and understandable as you were benefitting from it but some airdrops can reduce your crypto assets.</p>
<p>You will find thousands of paid free airdrops right now on internet out of them many are fake ones created by scammers with no long terms plans and goals for instance fake paid air drops ask you to buy with some popular crypto currency like Bitcoin or Ethereum etc then once you do that they will not send any crypto currency tokens to your wallet and then comes free fake air drops where you just have to pay transaction fees but here&#8217;s a catch the transaction fee including service fee is profit of scammer who neither give you free airdrop rewards even if they do still they most likely unworthy ones so beware of this only join valuable air drops by checking model and white paper etc.</p>
<p>Fake air drops are most common scam faced by new crypto currency investors after that fake send crypto currency get it double in return by today or tomorrow crypto currency digital platforms are booming up from past few years created by scammers where you have to send any crypto currency or token of any value that they asked once you do you will not get any thing in return even if you do in the beggining days that is basically trick to attract you to make bigger investments after you get addicted they stop sending back which is why don&#8217;t get trapped but in any case if you strongly want to invest in them then make sure to only invest tiny amount that you can afford to loose.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you may also find fake crypto earning and gaming apps and websites where you have to complete tasks or invest your crypto tokens to play the game of your choice from the available list over there even if you full-fill thousand tasks or invest you will not get penny in return you may say that as gambling but I say it as scam as most of them created by crooky scammers with code to make you loose every time so it&#8217;s up to you either to use them or not after that alot of newbies get into fake mining websites and apps.</p>
<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/5_what-are-crypto-currency-scams-and-how-to-stay-away-from-them.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/5_what-are-crypto-currency-scams-and-how-to-stay-away-from-them.webp" alt="5_what-are-crypto-currency-scams-and-how-to-stay-away-from-them" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>Thankfully, Mining is available in every crypto currency which uses your electronic devices power using software to solve algorithm blocks of crypto currency to authenticate and verify transactions for that you will get little percentage of crypto currency tokens in return but that require powerful hardware which is expensive else if you try with basic hardware available on smartphones it take years to complete one transaction that not even provide 1/10 of 1$ which is why majority of crypto miners now a days using cloud servers and pools.</p>
<p>Newbies who just learned about crypto currencies get attracted to crypto mining that&#8217;s cool as it rewards you crypto tokens for just installing an specific software on computer or smartphone then run it in background until it reaches withdrawal threshold while most of them are genuine that many pay you even after years but wait some are fake created by scammers where even if you reach payout threshold still they won&#8217;t pay as that softwares used your hardware power for thier earnings.</p>
<p>Atlast, majority of crypto currency scams and frauds happen in popular social media networks and messaging platforms like Telegram created by Pavel durov and Nikolai durov initially released in year 2013 is an privacy and security focused social messaging with powerful and advanced options and features who are known for not complying and providing private messages keys to any country law enforcement agencies due to that it is well used by extreme privacy carers.</p>
<p>So, Telegram is used by black hat hackers and criminals to do various types of scams mainly crypto as they are nearly impossible to trace by anyone same as TOR aka the onion router project vpn and darkweb where you will some times contacted by scammers with profile pictures of expert and professional business clothing style with sweet and favorable messages asking you to enroll in thier bots or websites to earn passive crypto currency income but most likely they are fake ones which don&#8217;t pay you including that there is high chances of getting hacked so completely away and don&#8217;t reply them in first place.</p>
<p>In sense, you will find crypto scams in every possible place on world wide web of internet not just in Telegram but also other social media and social messaging platforms it&#8217;s based on scammer risk appetite and current available anonymity technologies with him according to country laws which is why always make sure don&#8217;t fall in crypto or any scams.</p>
<p>Atlast, be alert when an unknown person send any link to you with unbelievable offers mainly related to crypto ones don&#8217;t click on them that may be phishing links to steal your credentials or inject spyware into your device in that way you will be in safe zone even if you somehow get scammed then try to bring awareness regarding this by saying about those scammers to your community and fellas then report it after that try to don&#8217;t fall in that same or other crypto scam trap again.</p>
<p>Finally, this are some top crypto currency scams and how to stay away from them, are you an existing victim of any crypto currency scam or fraud? If yes do say your experience and mention why and how you got scammed with scammers name or link in our comment section below so that fellow viewers will see to not getting scammed in near future, see ya 🙂</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Satoshi Nakamoto, a anonymous person in year 2009 created world&#8217;s first crypto [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/doge-solar-worlds-first-doge-metaverse-on-dogechain-for-dogecoin.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/doge-solar-worlds-first-doge-metaverse-on-dogechain-for-dogecoin.webp" alt="doge-solar-worlds-first-doge-metaverse-on-dogechain-for-dogecoin" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>Satoshi Nakamoto, a anonymous person in year 2009 created world&#8217;s first crypto currency named Bitcoin to replace fiat currency and remove middle mans like banks in order to get better security and transparency at that time it was new so value of Bitcoin is low but later on people around the world understood the potential of Bitcoin and considered as revolutionary due to that with in just few years Bitcoin become most valuable crypto currency.</p>
<p>Vitalik Buterin Gavin, a entrepreneur in inspiration of Bitcoin created his own crypto currency named Ethereum which received huge global recognition due to that it eventually reach #2 spot in popular crypto currency right below Bitcoin even today but Ethereum has scalability issues because of that transaction fees is super high more then other crypto currencies.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.techtracker.in/2021/07/how-to-use-matic-wallet-to-send.html" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">+ How To Use Matic Wallet To Send Ethereum At Very Low Gas Fees.</a></strong></p>
<p>But, the advantage of Ethereum is it is open source and decentralized just like Bitcoin which has publc blockchain API in that provided few standards out of them ERC721 allows anyone to build thier own NFT aka non fungible tokens or platforms with thier own changes to remove or add external features thanks to that developers and companies over the years for various purposes created millions of NFTs tokens and platforms based on Ethereum.</p>
<p>Fortunately, In year 2017 Ethereum developers Jaynti Kanani, Sandeep Nailwal, Anurag Arjun and Mihailo Bjelic launched Matic network that was later renamed as Polgon network which has it&#8217;s own token but protocols are designed to fix Ethereum scalability issues by simply processing it&#8217;s transactions on seperate ethereum supported blockchain then after post processing return to main Ethereum Blockchain in that way transactions fees is minimal which is why most people now a days using Polygon Network to send Ethereum.</p>
<p>Even though, after Bitcoin and Ethereum many developers and companies created thier own crypto networks but Polygon Network has most less fees like in cents which is open source and has it&#8217;s own public blockchain running alongside with Ethereum main blockchain so that you can make your own less transaction fee NFTs based on efficient Polygon Network.</p>

<p>Dogecoin is open source meme coin based on LiteCoin created by Billy Markus and Jackson as joke which has japanese dog Shiba inu as logo due to that or may be for other reasons with in few years Dogecoin got super popularity especially when Elon Musk entrepreneur and founder of Tesla and Space X frequently promoted it on his social media profiles mainly on Twitter and other media channels stating Dogecoin is far better then Bitcoin due to that alot of people buyed Dogecoin that increased it&#8217;s price to far new heights.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.techtracker.in/2021/12/the-future-of-doge-coin-everything-you.html" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">+ The future of doge coin : Everything you need to know!</a></strong></p>
<p>In sense, Dogecoin is based on scrypt algorithm which is more convenient and can confirm transactions in 1 minute but it lacks DeFi and other NFT products that&#8217;re available on other crypto networks due to that for few years Dogecoin users unable to enjoy but recently founder of Dogecoin developed layer 2 solution for Dogecoin named Dogechain for Dogecoin holders based on Ethereum which supercharges Dogecoin for bringing crypto applications like DApps, DeFi, Games, Metaverse etc.</p>
<p>However, Ethereum still has scalability issues so Dogechain relyed on Polygon Network that has largest ecosystem to further reduce transaction fees at the same time increase it&#8217;s speed and bring crypto dApps as soon as possible, anyway right now developers around the world by using Dogechain gradually building many dApps for Dogecoin to make it usable and adapt latest technologies.</p>
<p>We have numerous dApps aka decentralized apps based on Web3.0 concept an upgrade of available on crypto networks for various purposes based on different technologies thanks to crypto enthusiasts and companies who are now consantly working on to grow list of dApps out of them blockchain Metaverse is most exciting and interesting one.</p>
<p>Metaverse is concept of virtual world of internet where you will get map of any size on that people can create, buy and own digital platforms on particular area of map that anyone can one can access to check your block contents for information or to buy any products on digital shops which is fabulous isn&#8217;t? that may be the way we use and access world wide web in future.</p>

<p>Thankfully, many developers and companies globally build alot of Metaverse platforms which are mostly not based on blockchains but from past few years as we are rapidly developing alot of useful crypto platforms in that process developers build blockchain Metaverse.</p>
<p>In order to use blockchain Metaverse you have to connect with supported crypto wallet then you will get maps of real or fantasy world in that at some particular unoccupied area of your choice can create or build digital platforms like dApps, DeFi related to crypto network which people can acess to check to get information or buy and swap NFTs isn&#8217;t cool?</p>
<p>Most crypto networks has numerous Metaverse dApps except Dogecoin but recently as we have Dogechain that uses Polygon which has largest Metaverse studio so many developers and companies constantly working on to build full-fledged stable Metaverse for Dogecoin quickly.</p>
<p>Recently, we found world&#8217;s first Dogechain Metaverse named Doge Solar which is an virtual super power island project where you can ride dog Shiba inu ride on rocket to explore solar system over there you will find planets on each planet you developers build small dApps like contracts, DeFi, betting, mini games etc for users.</p>
<p>Usually, majority of Blockchain Metaverse projects has thier own NFT crypto token but as Doge Solar just launched on August 21 it currently don&#8217;t have it&#8217;s own crypto token but Solar Doge is planning to it&#8217;s launch token #DogeSolar this year in month of September, expect it soon.</p>
<p>Note : Doge Solar is still in beta stage which means development is in progress so you may find bugs or limited number of features but eventually Doge Solar may fix all issues and release more interesting and exciting features in future, so do you like it? are interested in Doge Solar ?

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/meson-best-defi-to-swap-usdc-to-usdt-vice-versa-with-no-fees.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/meson-best-defi-to-swap-usdc-to-usdt-vice-versa-with-no-fees.webp" width="400" alt="meson-best-defi-to-swap-usdc-to-usdt-vice-versa-with-no-fees"></a></p>
<p>In year 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto a unknown person introduced and released decentralized crypto currency named Bitcoin based on Web3 concept alternative to fiat currency that uses super modern technology due to that with in few years Bitcoin popularity and price increased and then developers around the world started making thier own crypto currencies with necessary platforms whenever required.</p>
<p>Crypto currencies are very secure and provide full security that are created to replace middle mans like banks but in early days of crypto currencies we don&#8217;t have many platforms except hardware wallets thus people don&#8217;t have many  options they used to buy specific crypto currency or token then store it on crypto hardware wallets to sell them to people or on CEX aka centralized exchanges.</p>
<p>Thankfully, now we have thousands of crypto currencies and millons of tokens in crypto world which has huge market thus we got centralized and decentralized crypto currencies where you can sell or trade crypto currencies and tokens same as stock market but crypto currencies are much more modern then stock market so to control and store them better we got several amazing Web3 platforms from developers and companies thanks to support from crypto enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Web3, is the future upgrade of internet where people host thier websites and blogs on decentralized servers instead of centralized servers that are operated by one or multiple companies who can access your information without permission even centralized servers are targeted and exploited by hackers to get data or to take down your website or blog through DDoS mitigation attacks.</p>
<p>While, websites and blogs that hosted on decentralized servers are very secure as the data is encrypted and divided into number of parts then uploaded on numerous servers thus it&#8217;s near impossible for hackers to exploit or take down Web3 websites and blogs including that Web3 websites and blogs are much faster and you&#8217;ll never face down time.</p>
<p>The concept of Web3 is well executed in crypto currency technology but still we use centralized exchanges to sell or buy crypto currencies that negatively impacts Web3 so to provide alternative to centralized exchanges we got decentralized crypto exchanges where no company take profits instead individuals stake thier crypto tokens in liquidity pools from where you will buy tokens and the individuals who staked crypto tokens will get commission based on several factors.</p>
<p>But, decentralized exchanges are not enough as now a days people creating thousands of crypto networks and tokens which are purchased by people on daily basis so to manage them efficiently we need better Web3 products then we got DeFi &#8211; decentralized finance platforms where you can buy, sell, transfer, sell, stake, swap, your crypto currencies..</p>
<p>DEX and DeFi platforms are based on Web3 that are included in latest crypto wallets known as dApps &#8211; decentralized apps fortunately we have numerous DEX and DeFi platforms but most of them take fee when you swap or transfer your crypto currency or token based on platform and network which most people don&#8217;t like.</p>
<p>Even though, there are few crypto networks like Binance Smartchain and Polygon where transfer fee is in cents but still crypto tokens swap fee is usually high in most DeFi platforms so as people don&#8217;t have any choice they use DeFi platforms to swap crypto currencies and crypto tokens.</p>
<p>Usually, almost all crypto currency price fluctuates according to market conditions but we also have stable crypto tokens like USDC and USDT which value set at 1$ so people who like to risk buy stable crypto tokens like USDC and USDT yet when you want to swap them for whatever reason you have to pay swap fee of 0.3% and additional bridge fee of upto $60 that&#8217;s super expensive right?</p>
<p>Most DeFi platforms charge fees when you swap USDC to USDT vice versa you may be ok with it but there are some people who are facing hard times to pay hefty swap fees so if you&#8217;re one of them and don&#8217;t want swap and transfer fee then your are at right spot we recently found a DeFi bridge named Meson where you can swap or transfer USDC to USDT vice versa with no fees.</p>
<p>Meson is an open source safe, costless and instant DeFi bridge to swap and transfer USDC and USDT vice versa crypto tokens with no fee and slippage on all major blockchains, so do we got your attention? are you interested in Meson? If yes let&#8217;s explore more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/how-to-create-your-own-crypto-currency-token-for-under-1.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/how-to-create-your-own-crypto-currency-token-for-under-1.webp" width="400" alt="how-to-create-your-own-crypto-currency-token-for-under-1"></a></p>
<p>Crypto currency is a decentralized digital currency first created in year 2009 by Satashi Nakamoto with Bitcoin to replace fiat currency and middle banks which are known to have several trust issues as per him crypto currency are way more secure  as they are tamper proof so you&#8217;ll get way better security and control over assets.</p>
<p>Even though, crypto currencies are not completely private as anyone in the world can check full assets and transactions of specific crypto network wallet through it&#8217;s blockchain where all your transactions are recorded and publicly available except few private coins like Monero but fortunately no one know your personal details which is why crypto currency is known for best privacy and transparency.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is ultra valuable now but in early days like any product bitcoin is not popular and worthy so alot of people who have thousands of bitcoins lost them while some people sell thier bitcoins for pizzas which are now worth of millions of dollars as Bitcoin is super modern and advanced  crypto currency slowly received huge global attention that&#8217;s what Satoshi Nakamoto wanted from start.</p>
<p>The founder of first decentralized crypto currency satoshi nakamoto didn&#8217;t wanted huge attention instead he preffered slow and stable growth of Bitcoin for stable success that eventually worked out but Satoshi Nakamoto only active in Bitcoin development till 2013 since then no one know who is Satoshi Nakamoto and what happened to him that increased the value of Bitcoins exponentially to new heights.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the team recruited by Satoshi Nakamoto continued the development of Bitcoin due to its popularity and futuristic technology as Bitcoin keep on growing in value people around the world started buying and storing bitcoins in thier crypto wallets for long time to sell them in future and get higher returns that decision made many people millionaire and billionaire.</p>
<p>The success and rise of Bitcoin especially it&#8217;s advanced and powerful technology inspired companies and developers to make thier own crypto currency like Bitcoin then in year 2015 Vitalik burik a russian developer with his team created Ethereum that eventually got popularity and become competitor to Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Ethereum is right now just behind Bitcoin it was unable to reach top position of crypto crypto currency list may be because of it&#8217;s high transaction fee and scalability issues but Ethereum is a crypto network where anyone can create thier own crypto token using Ethereum while in Bitcoin you can&#8217;t create your own crypto tokens.</p>
<p>Tokens are subset of crypto currency as not everyone can afford and make thier own crypto currency they started creating thier using crypto tokens using Ethereum blockchain but as Ethereum has high transaction fees known as gas fees crypto investors and enthusiastics people wanted best alternative to Ethereum then we got Binance smartchain.</p>
<p>Binance smartchain is highly scalable thus you will get very low transaction fees including that you can simply create crypto tokens using Binance like Ethereum since it&#8217;s very easy to create crypto tokens techies around the world started making thier own crypto tokens and listing them in centralized and decentralized exchanges.</p>
<p>Few years back, it&#8217;s simple to create crypto tokens but not everyone able to create them as to create crypto tokens you need some coding knowledge but now we have  many platforms where you can create crypto currency or tokens without coding thus many people creating thousands of crypto currencies and millions of tokens inspired by Bitcoin and Ethereum etc.</p>
<p>But, on most platforms you need to pay big amount of money to create crypto token on crypto currency mainnet then only you were able to sell them on crypto exchanges while testnets allow you to create crypto tokens for free but you can&#8217;t sell them on crypto exchanges they are developed to learn and test crypto tokens.</p>
<p>Recently, we found a platform named Smart Contracts where you can create crypto tokens on Binance Smartchain, Ethereum and Polygon mainet blockchain under 1$ with some restrictions so if you want complete features there are number of amazing paid plans so do you like it? are you interested in Smart Contracts? If yes let&#8217;s explore more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/steemit-best-decentralized-social-network-to-earn-crypto-online.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/steemit-best-decentralized-social-network-to-earn-crypto-online.webp" width="400" alt="steemit-best-decentralized-social-network-to-earn-crypto-online"></a></p>
<p>We have many popular social networks like Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Instagram etc out there on internet but these social networks use centralized server to store user database managed by company so due to single server hackers were able to exploit server to access users database which they can sell to advertising agencies or on darkweb even publish them online.</p>
<p>So, to fix this loopholes we are stepping towards Web3 a Decentralized upgraded internet where websites data are divided into bits then hosted on numerous servers provided by unknown individuals like you from around the world due to that hacking is difficult task even not possible.</p>
<p>Web3 platforms not only provide security and privacy but also load your website faster and you may never face down time as Web3 sites use decentralized servers over centralized server, now-a-days we got to see numerous decentralized platforms coming up to upgrade Internet to Web3.0 like crypto currency, DeFi &#8211; decentralized finance, cloud storage,  dVPNs etc.</p>
<p>Recently, we found an interesting decentralised social network powered by blockchain named Steemit which rewards crypto currency for engaging content isn&#8217;t it amazing? so do you like? are you interested in Steemit? If yes let&#8217;s know little info before we explore.</p>

<p>DeFi aka decentralised finance platforms based on web3 technology are specifically used to manage crypto currency, there you can store, buy, sell, stake crypto currencies eventhough many people don&#8217;t know about DeFi platforms as it&#8217;s still new in town but since 2018 DeFi platforms are on rise.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Juno network stakeholders for the first time voilates the fundamentals of crypto [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/juno-network-stakeholders-violates-fundamentals-of-crypto-currency.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/juno-network-stakeholders-violates-fundamentals-of-crypto-currency.webp" width="400" alt="juno-network-stakeholders-violates-fundamentals-of-crypto-currency"></a></p>
<p>Juno network stakeholders for the first time voilates the fundamentals of crypto currency by voting a proposal to rug pull funds of whale wallet who gambled juno Airdrop by creating 51 wallets instead 1, eventhough there is no written rules from juno network which states that a person shouldn&#8217;t create multiple wallets to join airdrop but still Juno network created a proposal to rug pull the funds of whale&#8217;s wallet and interestingly proposal is passed and juno stakeholders are excited to see what&#8217;s gonna happen in future.</p>
<p>In the history of crypto currency, Juno is the first crypto network to get a proposal to rug pull a crypto wallet which voilates the fundamentals of crypto currency, you may know the concept of crypto currency is to provide military grade security and privacy to users, that&#8217;s why crypto wallets generate backup phrases and say users to backup somewhere safe as they are the only method to recover funds.</p>
<p>In terms of legal and ethical perspective, a crypto network shouldn&#8217;t have right to rug pull a person crypto wallet, it&#8217;s not the job of a crypto network, however in order to do this juno network may have to halt chain and do software upgrade to empty the wallet of one person who owns 50k juno tokens in each of his 50 wallets and then later transferred them to one wallet with total worth of 2.5m juno tokens which is max for 1 wallet.</p>
<p>But, the question arises here is how the unknown person who created proposal #16 even know that the person who got all airdrop winnings in 1 wallet really gambled Airdrop? Isn&#8217;t there chance that airdrop winners intentionally transferred thier winnings to one wallet for whatever reasons, there is probability right, so how juno network able to create a proposal to rug pull some one&#8217;s crypto wallet without knowing and verifying details? Juno must understand the propoosal is childish and unprofessional.</p>
<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/1_juno-network-stakeholders-violates-fundamentals-of-crypto-currency.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/1_juno-network-stakeholders-violates-fundamentals-of-crypto-currency.webp" width="400" alt="1_juno-network-stakeholders-violates-fundamentals-of-crypto-currency"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2_juno-network-stakeholders-violates-fundamentals-of-crypto-currency.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2_juno-network-stakeholders-violates-fundamentals-of-crypto-currency.webp" width="400" alt="2_juno-network-stakeholders-violates-fundamentals-of-crypto-currency"></a></p>
<p>Eventhough, proposal #16 rug pull proposal won by slight upvote percentage and then only it was passed yet how juno network know the voting is genuine, isn&#8217;t there chance of fake voting? people can create multiple wallets or account to fake vote same as the person who created 51 wallets to join airdrop.</p>
<p>Actually, a guy named Jacob Gadikian created a proposal #4 back in 2021-10-12 to reduce 90% fund and blacklist of same wallet, as they believe Airdrop is gamed, but thankfully proposol #4 was rejected, what&#8217;s suspicious here is when the proposal #4 and proposal #16 is for same, purpose? why only proposal #16 passed? isn&#8217;t this shady? </p>
<p>Anyhow, proposal #16 to to rug pull funds of wallet was somehow passed, and juno stakeholders waiting to know how Juno network going to respond and move on this, if Juno network rejects the passed proposol #16 then there will be some dissapointed from juno stakeholders who voted to rug pull, but if juno network passes proposal #16 then it&#8217;s illogical and voilates the fundamentals of crypto world, let&#8217;s see what will happen?</p>
<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/3_juno-network-stakeholders-violates-fundamentals-of-crypto-currency.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/3_juno-network-stakeholders-violates-fundamentals-of-crypto-currency.webp" width="400" alt="3_juno-network-stakeholders-violates-fundamentals-of-crypto-currency"></a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Takumi Asano created and published draft of an official <a href="https://commonwealth.im/juno/discussion/4054-create-an-official-constitution-including-the-vision-of-the-core1-team" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">constitution</a>  which includes the vision of the Core-1 team and for governence of Juno network, you heard that right constitution for crypto network, while in parallel Takuma Asano and his supporters already voilated the basic fundamentals or crypto currency with proposol #4 and #16.</p>
<p>In my opinion, proposal #4 and #16 are completely wrong, decentrailised crypto networks are created for security of funds and privacy of users, crypto networks are not banks to seize funds whenever they want, crypto networks work with different agenda and technologies, if you apply the principles of bank on crypto networks then it won&#8217;t work as satoshi nakamoto created world&#8217;s first decentrailised crypto currency bitcoin for an better and secure alternative to banks, including that crypto networks are not even legalised in most countries.</p>
<p>Finally, this is Juno a decentrailised crypto network just like bitcoin, ethereum tron and solana, but are you an existing user of juno network? If yes have you voted proposal #4 and proposal #16? do say us why you supported them in our comment section below, see ya 🙂 </p>

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin is world&#8217;s first decentrailised crypto currency created by Satoshi Nakamoto in [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/button-wallet-buy-sell-exchange-crypto-assets-on-telegram.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/button-wallet-buy-sell-exchange-crypto-assets-on-telegram.webp" width="400" alt="button-wallet-buy-sell-exchange-crypto-assets-on-telegram"></a></p>
<p>Bitcoin is world&#8217;s first decentrailised crypto currency created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, even though bitcoin is not popular in the beginnings but eventually Bitcoin become the world&#8217;s most valued and popular crypto currency in just few years, even today Bitcoin ranks at top then Ethereum and other crypto currencies follows which are probably inspired by Bitcoin.</p>
<p>The term crypto currency is widely used only after bitcoin come into existence, now we have millions of decentrailised crypto currencies like bitcoin out there on Internet based on thier own technology, so like we have stock exchanges for stocks, crypto currencies also has thier own centralised crypto exchanges aka CEX from different platforms to buy, sell and exchange crypto currency online.</p>
<p>Crypto currencies are digital currency that has it&#8217;s own market like stock market, but as crypto currency is digital money you can store them in crypto wallets just like you store physical money in bank and use them via digital wallets to send or receive between people, incase of bank once you send or receive money you will surely get transaction details through reciept, while when you send or receive crypto currency you will get transaction details from the network of your crypto currency which records successful transactions for example : blockchain of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>However, Banks don&#8217;t use any miners to validate and records transactions using technology like blockchain, but majority of crypto currencies utilise and depend on  crypto miners to validate transactions who use hardware power or cloud servers to solve blocks of code to verify and record transactions and thier crypto network like blockchain and yeah crypto miners will get small percentage % of crypto rewards for doing this job.</p>
<p>Anyhow, to trade crypto currencies you need crypto exchanges and incase if you want to store, send or receive crypto currency then majority of crypto owners use crypto wallets, we have numerous crypto wallet platforms on internet out there on internet so you have choice.</p>
<p>Recently, we found a un-official light and convienient crypto wallet bot named Button wallet created by Alekasndr Safonov to buy, sell, exchange crypto currencies with many features on popular and advanced social messaging platform Telegram which is known for privacy and security developed by pavel durov and Nikolai durov in 2013.</p>
<p>Note : Telegram is indeed an amazing platform for anonymity, but un-official bots are created by third party bot developers using Telegram public API so Telegram won&#8217;t take any responsibility as there is data theft risk on un-official bots, you can&#8217;t trust un-official bots even if they ensure data protection, so use @buttonwalletbot at your own risk we are not responsible for any personal data and financial losses, we just shown demo for information purposes only, do you still want to use this bot @buttonwalletbot? If yes let&#8217;s know little more info before we explore more.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[There are numerous ways to invest money online, as digital technology paved [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/how-to-stake-sentinel-dvpn-tokens.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/how-to-stake-sentinel-dvpn-tokens.webp" width="400" alt="how-to-stake-sentinel-dvpn-tokens"></a></p>
<p>There are numerous ways to invest money online, as digital technology paved the way for everyone to invest on assets which are not available to invest online for Example : gold which is now become digital gold and back in 90&#8217;s in order to invest in stocks you have find brokers and buy physical stocks which is difficult task but now due to new advanced technologies we got numerous brokers to invest on digital stocks online.</p>
<p>However, when most people sticked to digital stocks to invest money online then in year 2009 the world&#8217;s first decentrailised crypto currency named Bitcoin a digital asset build on blockchain technology was created by Satoshi nakamoto entered into the world calmly and revolutionized the way people invest money online.</p>
<p>Bitcoin, within few years become world&#8217;s most popular and valuable digital asset even though crypto currencies are neither recognised or legalised by governments, after bitcoin many more cryptocurrencies come into existence like ethereum which is considered as first alternative to bitcoin, anyhow Bitcoin still ranks top even today.</p>
<p>The undeniable fact is any crypto currency that came after 2009 is inspired by Bitcoin and when thousands of new cryptos were created by people then there is necessity of exchanges so like we have stock market for stocks we got crypto market platforms from numerous companies to buy and sell crypto currencies online.</p>
<p>However, when investors are busy managing stocks and crypto currencies, we got another potential investment digital asset named NFT aka non-fungible-tokens which are build using same principles and blockchain technology of crypto currency, so NFT&#8217;s can be said as subset of crypto currency but if you want to sell or buy NFT&#8217;S you need crypto currency.</p>
<p>Now a days NFT&#8217;s are more popular then crypto currencies, because of NFT digital arts and meme coins like Shiba inu, Baby doge etc which got attention from world&#8217;s most aspiring entrepreneur Elon Musk on his twitter handle, and just like any crypto currency you can trade or mine NFT&#8217;s to.</p>
<p>But, as you may know trading is risky and mining crypto currencies is difficult which require alot of power to validate and solve blocks to verify transactions and then get rewards, so people whoever want to earn crypto currency and NFT&#8217;s without trading and mining are buying and staking crypto currencies or NFT&#8217;s on liquidity pools to get additional rewards.</p>
<p>We have numerous ways to stake crypto currencies and NFT&#8217;S, while most popular methods are liquidity staking, crypto yield farming and new in town NFT&#8217;s staking is trending in crypto community as it offers increased returns when investors choose to lock in thier funds for longer term and yeah for any type of staking you have to depend on DeFi platforms.</p>
<p>In simple, Staking is like security deposit you have to lock your crypto currencies or NFT&#8217;S in vault and then staking platform will have thier own fees and APR : annual percentage rage based on that and your total investment they will send validators to solve blocks and then in exchange you will get rewards on daily basis which is very safe over trading and mining.</p>
<p>Now, the question arises which is best crypto currency or non-fungible-token for higher returns which is hard to say as your investments and exchange APR rate will play major role in staking, anyway we&#8217;re going to show you how to stake sentinel dVPN tokens which you can use to top up bandwidth on Exidio dVPN.</p>
<p>Exidio dVPN is a decentrailised VPN based on Sentinel, you may never heard of dVPN as it&#8217;s still new and growing technology which provide better privacy and security then normal VPNs as dVPN nodes are hosted by users like you over companies which may use for your data for marketing purposes, experts says dVPN is like VPN over TOR so that you will get fast internet speed and security at the same time.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.techtracker.in/2022/03/exidio-dvpn-get-500gb-of-decentralized.html" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">+ Exidio dVPN &#8211; Get 500GB of decentralized privacy and security for just $1.</a></strong></p>
<p>Note : In my opinion, Exidio is not more secure then TOR but definitely better then VPN for sure, the reason is the node you connect on Exidio dVPN will become the exit node which law enforcements can abuse to monitor you, Exidio doesn&#8217;t use numerous nodes to transfer traffic so determining the original traffic source is pretty easy and simple.</p>
<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/1_how-to-stake-sentinel-dvpn-tokens.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/1_how-to-stake-sentinel-dvpn-tokens.webp" width="400" alt="1_how-to-stake-sentinel-dvpn-tokens"></a></p>
<p>So, I didn&#8217;t like this and went on to Sentinel support and suggested the Exidio Team to make Exidio app users to select upto 100  nodes of thier choice and make app in a way that once user connected to a node it will automatically jump to different node at random intervals, so that it will offer better decentrailised experience for privacy and security, and within 10 minutes I got reply from Exidio platform co-founder and CEO Dan Edlebeck stating that personally he really like my suggestion and they&#8217;ll will look into feasibility of implementing such feature, isn&#8217;t this amazing?</p>
<p>There are two best and we&#8217;ll known DeFi platforms available out there on internet to stake Sentinel dVPN tokens, there are Kepler and Cosmostation you can choose anyone, so do you like it? are you interested in Sentinel dVPN staking? If yes let&#8217;s know little more info before we explore more.</p>

<p>Crypto currencies are no doubt popular digital assets to invest and earn money for short terms and long term, people started to prefer crypto currencies like bitcoin over stock market for it&#8217;s high returns, however when it comes to investments you should always choose legal and low risk assets like stock market, but when it comes to crypto currencies there are neither have proper laws or regulated by government entity, this is why investment on crypto currencies are more risker then on stock markets in any country.</p>
<p>Experts from financial background and government bodies frequently say that crypto currency sooner or later will be banned and the investments you done over the period can be at huge risk even end up with un-bearable losses, even after such warnings people are still interested to invest on crypto currency and the main big reason behind it was huge returns in short time and no requirement of trading skills, this is why people invest in crypto currency and once invested in any crypto coin they can sit back and relax.</p>
<p>How ever, crypto currency market is just like stock market, there will be liquidity and volatility, so either in stocks or cryptos you must analyse and choose such crypto coin which has stability and future, if you invest on bad crypto coins then you may end up with losses, usually most people especially newbies invest in those crypto coins which has no potential to grow due to lack of knowledge thus they were not able to sustain in crypto market.</p>
<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/1_how-to-invest-in-crypto-currencies-like-a-pro-and-earn-fast-profits.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/1_how-to-invest-in-crypto-currencies-like-a-pro-and-earn-fast-profits.webp" width="400" alt="1_how-to-invest-in-crypto-currencies-like-a-pro-and-earn-fast-profits"></a></p>
<p>Majority of people don&#8217;t know and forget that crypto currencies are neither legalised or regulated by government, most vendors doesn&#8217;t accept crypto currencies, so there are certain things that people should keep in mind when investing in crypto currency, those are if you decided to invest in crypto currencies then you must study and know atleast basics of stock markets.</p>
<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2_how-to-invest-in-crypto-currencies-like-a-pro-and-earn-fast-profits.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2_how-to-invest-in-crypto-currencies-like-a-pro-and-earn-fast-profits.webp" width="400" alt="2_how-to-invest-in-crypto-currencies-like-a-pro-and-earn-fast-profits"></a></p>
<p>Basically, when investing in stock market you have to primarily analyse stock fundamentals, market sentiment and movement, stock volatility, liquidity  charts etc and then invest on such stock which has ability to grow in short or long term, and same applies to crypto currency market, but when you think of investing in crypto currencies for long term then there is huge risk unless the country where you live is completely legalised crypto coins, if you care about safety of your investments then is better to not to enroll for long term investments on crypto currencies.</p>
<p>if you want to invest in crypto currencies and earn money like pro then you should prefer short term investments on crypto currency as it is safer and can reap good profits, if you know stock market terms then we are suggesting swing trading on crypto coins, in swing trading trader will analyse market and buy good stocks or crypto assets after that trader will wait until his stock or crypto assets get into profits, it can take few weeks or months then trader will sell his stocks or crypto assets to get profits in short time.</p>
<p>Usually, most stock market experts suggest and recommend swing trading over intraday and long term investment over swing trading, however as we said earlier long term investments has huge risk on crypto currencies, so it&#8217;s better to stick with low risk short term investment, but at the end any investments in stock or crypto market is risky, so beware of this.</p>
<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/3_how-to-invest-in-crypto-currencies-like-a-pro-and-earn-fast-profits.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/3_how-to-invest-in-crypto-currencies-like-a-pro-and-earn-fast-profits.webp" width="400" alt="3_how-to-invest-in-crypto-currencies-like-a-pro-and-earn-fast-profits"></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m just saying long terms investments in crypto currency is risky, kindly note : I&#8217;m not giving any financial suggestion, if you are ready to take risk and face any type of outcome in future, then you can do long term investment in crypto currency, but it is always suggested in stock market or crypto market kindly don&#8217;t invest money which you are not ready to loose, don&#8217;t invest in cryptos or stocks by taking loans or someone else money, only invest 1/10 aka 10% money of total money that you&#8217;re interested to invest and don&#8217;t invest that money which you&#8217;ve saved for personal safety and usages.</p>
<p>In simple, crypto market run on same principles of stock market but legality is the only issue of crypto market, so to earn money on crypto currencies, just do swing trading on crypto currency, you have to buy stable and valuable crypto coins which you believe will grow at lowest price possible and sell them at its peak price, whenever you get the opportunity in short time.</p>
<p>Finally, this is how to invest like a pro on  crypto currency and earn money, we are using swing trading strategy, do you use same or any other strategies? If you use swing trading what do you think about it? If you use any other investment strategies or wanna suggest or say something about or regarding this, then kindly do mention in our comment section below, see ya 🙂</p>
