<p>SIM aka subscriber identity module is basically a chip that you may probably using on your mobiles and smartphones extensively isn&#8217;t it? If so you may have seen it number of times right? It comes in different sizes based on device to fit well which back is coated with very thin layer of gold so don&#8217;t ever think to sell it you&#8217;ll get 0$ unless it&#8217;s an antique but with just that and unique serial number you can do alot of things as sim card basically work as bridge between you and your telecom network to access all their services like voice calls, sms, internet data and many more which is very revolutionary wireless communication technology that connects people around the world effectively.</p>
<p>Usually, there will be number of small or big telecom operators or you may call networks in most countries unless it&#8217;s undeveloped one and each country put strict terms and conditions on telecom companies as communication technology that they provide to citizens and people in their country has pros and cons which is why governments establish a personal body to regulate them like for Instance TRAI aka telecom regulatory authority of India and release legal statements like that no telecom operator can provide sim cards to anyone unless they provide all necessary government documents like social security number, passport, driving licence etc after that they should verify details and process it if geniune and then activate that simcard in 24 hours so that no can use it in bulk or for illegal purposes etc all this protocols made for safety.</p>
<p>Each sim card comes with unique 10 digit number pre-set by telecom operator which all only work if we add country code in start of it like for Instance united states has +1 as country code based on sim card number there will be price set by telecom operator like for normal random number you&#8217;ll mostly pay regular price but for specialized custom number with same number repeated times popularly known as fancy number you have to pay big price which is why except few people and huge companies majority of people worldwide use common ones at the end any number normal or expensive ones doesn&#8217;t matter users in most cases get same simcard as it&#8217;s such small size that we can&#8217;t do much on externally even if you do in most cases you&#8217;ll not inject out of device as nowadays it become part of ourselves isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>Especially, most telecom networks use plastic to make sim card with very thin layer of gold or silver coating that has no value unless you collected tons of sim cards but the technology which it unleash when connected to electronic device is precious that provide numerous value added services wirelessly to users in location wherever the telecom network is available constantly unless there is any issues in telecom network or bad weather conditions etc and yeah to access and use value added telecom services you must have to buy a prepaid or postpaid simcard and recharge it with flexible monthly or annually plans whenever you want from offline stores or online portals very easily due to such potential and user-friendliness of sim cards there is large userbase which is more than WiFi thanks to such demand and to be up to date almost all telecom operators upgrading sim cards internally by adapting to latest technologies.</p>
<p>But thing is as you may know sim cards that we use now is same plastic ones that we used a decade ago ever wondered why is it like this when since long time it&#8217;s internal technologies being upgraded well to put in simple in my opinion there&#8217;s no need for it and a lot of people face issues handling physical sim cards out of them most people don&#8217;t even like or prefer to use them due to various different reasons to name few sim cards can be damaged just simple scratch or break on it&#8217;s back thin layer make it unusable and if you use many sim cards it is bit difficult to manage them unless your device has multiple slots which are few drawbacks so to eradicate them for the first time Apple inc. back in year 2017 on it&#8217;s X series smartphones introduced a revolutionary technology known as esim aka electronic sim.</p>
<p>However, even after number of years e-sim is not widely available on smartphones except premium flagship smartphones have you ever wondered why? e-sim is integrated into your device but to enable you&#8217;re interested telecom operator must support it though at first most telecom operators used to don&#8217;t have support for e-sim technology but eventually thanks to popularity of Apple inc. many devices and telecom started adding it yet still 90% of smartphones don&#8217;t have it because of whatever reasons majority of companies didn&#8217;t add on low and budget smartphones isn&#8217;t that quite dissapointing? though e-sim setup takes more times than normal sim cards yet thanks to it&#8217;s electronic modern technology large percentage of people want to use them on unsupported smartphones which is directly not possible unless you have skills to do the job.</p>
<p>In sense, if you don&#8217;t have much technical indept skills then you very much won&#8217;t be able to directly add and use e-sim on unsupported devices but Incase you definitely want to somehow use the e-sim technology on unsupported devices then for people like you I recently got to know about an futuristic company named e-sim.me that provides a sim card physical one but connect on smartphone with the help of its proprietary technology and app it can store more then 15 sim card profiles which work in every sim slot supported device and country though current price is quite expensive in some countries but it&#8217;s path breaking technology with support for thousands of devices and usefulness is surely outstanding, don&#8217;t you think?</p>
<p>e-sim.me is new technology in market that didn&#8217;t got much spotlight as of now that will surely get more recognition in future as it can convert existing physical sim cards into digital ones at present it is purchasable on official portal and ships worldwide though it&#8217;s already amazing with just one sim you&#8217;ll be able to use more then 10 e-sims but it will be way more awesome if e-sim.me was able to put out a technology or you can may say trick or method that can add e-sims on unsupported devices without any physical simcard from e-sim.me as well don&#8217;t you think? at present the availability of this technology is no doubt is quite fulfilling for those who require this immediately, are you one of them? do you like it? are you interested? If yes let&#8217;s explore more.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Nokia, is it your first keypad mobile phone? majority of people around [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/how-to-record-nokia-ozo-spatial-audio-on-android-devices.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/how-to-record-nokia-ozo-spatial-audio-on-android-devices.webp" width="400" alt="how-to-record-nokia-ozo-spatial-audio-on-android-devices"></a></p>
<p>Nokia, is it your first keypad mobile phone? majority of people around the world had their first keypad mobile phone from Nokia as back then like few decades they&#8217;re very dominant strong hold keypad mobile phone maker globally for long time but due to poor business decisions back in time they didn&#8217;t entered into smartphones industry when most of it&#8217;s competitors like Samsung and many companies around the world started making smartphones.</p>
<p>Smartphones are handheld electronic device evolution of mobile phones and PDAs came with modern technologies to replace keypad mobile phones which has powerful hardware and advanced software to do almost all tasks of PCs aka personal  computers in it&#8217;s own way by using it you can not just install digital softwares but also make telecom network based calls and messages etc, isn&#8217;t that amazing?</p>
<p>Since, the entry of first smartphone as it&#8217;s revolutionary and pretty useful people in large numbers started buying and shifting to them from. keypad mobile phones to stay up to date that drasically increased demand for smartphones so numerous companies started making plans to make them except Nokia but the main challenge they have to is develop operating system basically software for smartphones which is hard and take long time as well.</p>
<p>Most companies like Samsung, Sony, LG have existing infrastructure to make top notch quality hardware for smartphones but what they lack is advanced proper software that compete with Apple Inc&#8217;s iPhone closed source operating system iOS but eventually in just 1 year Google launched amazing open source operating system named Android that anyone can use it so number of people and companies started using it on smartphones.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Nokia being pioneer and #1 top keypad mobile phone maker after few years when it&#8217;s competitors like Samsung already got hold of smartphones market eventually started making smartphones as per trend to make business and supply the demand from customers but once again Nokia did another blunder mistake by not using Android on it&#8217;s smartphones instead they Integrated custom SymbianOS.</p>
<p>SymbianOS is well known and popular open source operating system that was actually made for PDAs but Nokia is one of the main backers of SymbianOS which they used on most keypad mobile phones after that they Integrated on smartphones but it&#8217;s not upto mark to right on compete with Android including that most people back then got used to Android so didn&#8217;t given much attention and recognition to SymbianOS, are you one of them?</p>
<p>Anyhow, In the end SymbianOS failed that negetively effected Nokia who already got huge financial losses due to failure of it&#8217;s SymbianOS smartphones yet somehow able to continue thanks to it&#8217;s brand value and trusted customers worldwide at that time Nokia for whatever reasons didn&#8217;t use Android software instead partnered with PC software maker Microsoft to develop and release Windows Lumia series.</p>
<p>Lumia series smartphones got applause for it&#8217;s hardware and software quality and appreciated the partnership of Nokia and Microsoft but eventually for almost same reasons Windows software on the Nokia Lumia smartphones failed mainly due to lack of apps and user friendly developer support including that most people liked and preffered Android smartphones over Windows that hit hard on Nokia this time it negetively effected them immensely.</p>
<p>In sense, Nokia failed in smartphone market as they decided to not use Android even if they acknowledged it&#8217;s potential or not doesn&#8217;t matter at the people see the result, anyway Nokia continued it&#8217;s keypad mobile phone business which is running pretty well now but smartphone sector is shelved for more then decade now they may not start it again anytime soon.</p>
<p>However, the employees of Nokia by talking trademark rights of Nokia started making Nokia brand smartphones under HMD Global a chinese company which is now making stock Android based Nokia smartphones with long term updates and upgrades like iOS including that they are making innovative technologies to add on their Nokia smartphones like OZO.</p>
<p>OZO is spatial digital audio recording technology from Nokia specifically designed and developed for it&#8217;s ozo virtua reality camera and some smartphones as well camera which uses all mics basically 3 to record from all sides to give surround sound but this technology is not available on official audio recording app of Nokia.</p>
<p>There is huge demand from customers to get spatial recording technology on app instead in camera but for whatever reasons Nokia didn&#8217;t Integrated it at that time XDA senior developer named black.rider555 ported few codes of OZO into official audio recording app of Nokia and added spatial recording technology isn&#8217;t that super cool and awesome?</p>
<p>Now there is one mod of Nokia recorder app that support OZO spatial audio  format including that black.rider555 changed theme and also forced surround sound which use 3 mics at once but as this technology is made for camera it&#8217;s better to record sounds in landscape mode on smartphones just like recording video even if you don&#8217;t do anyone on this you will still get high quality for sure.</p>
<p>Usually, sound that recorded and processed using digital technologies like software developed using programming languages on electronic devices is known as audio which mostly use 1 microphone as each microphone used for different purposes like calling but this OZO spatial technology use more mics then usual thus you&#8217;ll get better quality then regular ones.</p>
<p>In our test of spatial recording on mod nokia sound recorder of black.rider555 we clearly seen quite big noticeable difference of audio quality, we tested system default sound recorder app at the end in comparison mod Nokia sound recorder is not just way better but also provided clear high quality audio which you can definitely use on the go.</p>
<p>Note : Black.rider555 ported this sound recorder for Nokia and other smartphones which support spatial recording technology so keep that mind though you may still able to install and open to use on any Android smartphones but spatial audio may not work if it does then all is well, so do you like it? are you interested? If yes then let&#8217;s explore more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/vphonegaga-run-android-inside-android-alternative-to-vmos-pro.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/vphonegaga-run-android-inside-android-alternative-to-vmos-pro.webp" width="400" alt="vphonegaga-run-android-inside-android-alternative-to-vmos-pro"></a></p>
<p>What you&#8217;ll do? If you want to send and receive calls and messages? or capture real world digitally you most likely use a smartphone to get it done isn&#8217;t it? which is an evolution of keypad mobile phones and PDAs aka personal digital assistants that was Integrated with many hardware parts and operating system basically softwares developed using number of programming languages that work with different types of charged batteries like lithium-ion ones powered by electrons due to that they are  known as electronic devices by using them you can execute and run almost all real life tasks electronically and digitally.</p>
<p>Especially, smartphones are basically handheld electronic devices so you can use it on the go which can do almost all tasks of PCs in it&#8217;s own way but usually smartphones cannot handle modern PC level heavy resources softwares due to lack of limited storage and memory but as you may know companies for personal or commercial purposes rapidly progressing in development of smartphones who were upgrading hardware to power up and also advancing software accordingly.</p>
<p>Fortunately, thanks to number of companies now we have flagship smartphones with inbuilt powerful hardware and advanced software which are capable of running heavy resources softwares yet still not totally reached the level of modern PCs as smartphones are usually sealed by default so you can&#8217;t easily add additional hardware parts like graphic cards or central processing unit etc externally unless you are an skilled technician which is why a lot of people do certain tasks using modern PCs.</p>
<p>However, now a days majority of people use handheld smartphones as most tasks can simply done on them including that as smartphones are pocket friendly you are able to use them more comfortably and conveniently but at the end as smartphone makers on their operating systems restrict access to system level files to protect your device as altering them without knowledge can damage device due to that unless you somehow unlock system level access on smartphone you can&#8217;t customize operating systems of smartphone extensively.</p>
<p>On PCs in just few keyboard commands and mouse pointer clicks you can run as super administrator to change or edit even even delete or add files on system folders or softwares etc but it is different on smartphones where in order to run as super administrator you have to first unlock bootloader then install custom recovery like TeamWin recovery project to flash rooting software to get system level access that voids device warranty.</p>
<p>There are different hardware and operating systems available for smartphones based on that rooting has to be done properly for instance in order to root Android a popular operating system for smartphones you have to root it using Supersu or it&#8217;s better version Magisk then you&#8217;re able to modify or change system level files to get extra functionalities which are not provided by OEMs isn&#8217;t super cool and amazing?</p>
<p>However, you don&#8217;t have to root Android powered smarphones to install additional custom software versions of Android but it is not easy as each Android smartphone has different process you have to make or change system files internally for that we have number of development forums with detailed simplified methods for almost all smartphones which you can simply apply on your smartphone to get it done.</p>
<p>But, if you are someone who don&#8217;t know basic technical terms of Android or neither have interest to know them yet still like to do rooting and install custom softwares carelessly then most likely you may end up messing right software structure of your Android that can surely cause personal or financial data losses as alternating certain Android system files even mistakenly can make smartphone unusable which is why a lot of people don&#8217;t do such stuff they will instead usually satisfied with locked and stock Android powered smartphones.</p>
<p>In case, the smartphone that your owned is new and under warranty and you don&#8217;t want to lose it by breaking into locked device system directories yet still want to install another custom Android software, maybe you think it as useful or handy can be used as secondary operating system where you simply store or workout private matters with more anonymity then you can use virtual machine software but to install and run it you need personal computer.</p>
<p>Usually, the majority of virtual machines are available for PCs which are capable of running both desktop and mobile operating systems efficiently but not everyone has PCs isn&#8217;t it? If you do then it&#8217;s fine yet still if you may don&#8217;t want to use PCs virtual software for whatever reasons instead want to use them on smartphones then I like to inform you that there are a number of virtual machine apps available for smartphones as well.</p>
<p>Virtual machine emulate hardware and software of particular electronic device hardware or software in it&#8217;s code digitally  so that you&#8217;re able to run certain operating system even if your PC or smartphone etc doesn&#8217;t have any compatible hardware or software to execute them but making this virtual machines is kinda difficult they are created by third party developers manually without support from official makers that&#8217;s why they are considered as unofficial and it takes years to make them correctly.</p>
<p>The main reason why most third party developers take so much time to develop virtual machine softwares is due to lack of proper resources which is why almost all  virtual machine developers publish their software code as foss aka free and open source on many contributive development platforms like GitHub where programmers through Internet plus browsers around the world can commit code to improve or even use public code to make thier own custom virtual machines in this process we&#8217;re not only getting quite better virtual machines softwares but also fast stable ones.</p>
<p>Anyhow, on Android virtual machine softwares are basic where you can though run all desktop operating systems using emulators like Limbo and Exagear etc but they won&#8217;t work as smoothly on PCs even see lag and glitches most times as even the flagship smartphones are not yet powerful enough to compete with modern PCs but as of now Android virtual machine apps are capable enough to run Android in full scale efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p>There are closed and open source virtual machines available for smartphones and PCs, while in the private virtual machines softwares you won&#8217;t be able to see certain code that is encrypted by developers due to various reasons like may be they don&#8217;t want to show up their code and let others use it or they hidden malware or sneeky data trackers into it that will snatch your data without informing you which is why it&#8217;s better to rignt on go with open source ones where you can check and verify code of software to be in safe zone.</p>
<p>Even though, free and open source virtual machines are definitely always better then closed because they provide transparency that guarantees user privacy and security but right we have very few free and open source virtual machine softwares available for Android like Twoyi and most of them lack many required options and features which are available on closed ones that&#8217;s why if you want more necessary stuff then may be it&#8217;s better to go with closed source virtual machine softwares for sure.</p>
<p>Recently, we found an Android virtual machine app which is better then VMOS Pro with numerous amazing options and features named Vphonegaga that currently runs Android 7.1 and Android 10 stable for 32 bit and 64 bit smarphones that even support new Android versions in future including that it comes with in-build root and Magisk support to not just improve but also ultra customize Android so do you like it? are you interested in Vphonegaga, if yes then let&#8217;s explore more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/how-to-play-windows-mobile-games-on-android-using-wpr-emulator.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/how-to-play-windows-mobile-games-on-android-using-wpr-emulator.webp" alt="how-to-play-windows-mobile-games-on-android-using-wpr-emulator" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>When computers used to be just mechanical machines first invented by Charles Babbage in early 18th century then as time goes in this world of rapid progress and competition every invention will evolve like wise computers got alot of improvements and upgrades especially in mid 19th century at that time we got many electric and electronic computers mainly in America by number of companies and inventors to name few ENIAC &#8211; Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer and ABC &#8211; Atanasoff-Berry computer etc.</p>
<p>But, most computers back then are not digital they completely used to rely on mechanisms of hardware parts powered totally by electricity for various operations and purposes then in just few years in year 1948 on 21st June a electronic computer named Manchester baby computer ran a software based on the storage program concept developed using programming languages written by Kilburn consisted of 17 instructions that would find the highest factor of a given number, isn&#8217;t amazing?</p>
<p>Machester baby is revolutionary computer which inspired and paved the way for many inventors and companies to make computers in Integration with softwares but back then almost all computers used to be very basic yet big and expensive thus not everyone can afford them even if they do computers are not home compatible thus it&#8217;s hard to arrange space to maintain them due to that they are mostly limited to few universities and companies.</p>
<p>Fortunately, In just few decades by year 1970s thanks to competiton among companies who developed number of revolutionary and amazing technologies to reduce size and price of computers in that process we got personal computers first created by kenbak corporation named Kenbak 1 after that we got number of personal computers out of them Altair 8080 is one of the most popular one.</p>
<p>Altair 8800 is also considered as world&#8217;s first personal or micro computer based on Intel 8080 CPU which is commercially limited but got attention of Harvard University students Bill Gates and Paul Allen who contacted MITS and able to get deal to develop interpretor for Altair 8800 after that Bill Gates drop out college to found Microsoft company with Paul Allen in year 1974 then they together developed BASIC for Altair 8800 which is considered as high level programming language.</p>
<p>Microsoft in begginings used to create softwares for number of personal computers according to deal and requirements of companies in that process as per contract with IBM aka international business machines a pioneer company in manufacturing of computers in year 1980s Microsoft buyed an software and modified it to develop MS-DOS a disk based CLI aka command line interface operating system basically software to execute and run on IBM PCs.</p>
<p>MS-DOS is undoubtedly remarkable operating system that recieved wide attention and recognition around the world for Microsoft then after few years in year 1985 Microsoft developed an GUI aka graphical user interface based operating system known as Windows which is way better then CLI ones but actually first GUI based computer was created by Xerox Parc in year 1973 named Alto computer.</p>
<p>Even though, there are numerous GUI based operating system out there on market but Microsoft windows is most popular and huge commercial succesfull product because it&#8217;s much better then any CLI or GUI based operating system thanks to efforts of Microsoft team but Windows for long time only developed for PCs even when numerous cool and interesting modern mobile operating systems are rising up in era of smartphones.</p>
<p>Apple inc. developed world&#8217;s first revolutionary multi-touch technology closed source feature rich powerful hardware and advanced software smartphone named iPhone released by it&#8217;s founder to replace keypad mobile phones which got incredible sells despite it&#8217;s expensive price that shaked up the global market and become trouble some to many mobile companies so as per demand they started making plans and strategies to make smartphone same as iPhone.</p>
<p>iPhone in it&#8217;s first release don&#8217;t have name for it&#8217;s operating system which was based on OS X but from iPhone 2 released in year 2008 Apple inc. named operating system as iOS at that time search engine giant Google developed it&#8217;s existing operating system Android that was actually acquired from Andy Rubens in year 2005 and then in partnership with renowned Taiwanese mobile company HTC manufactured and released it&#8217;s world&#8217;s first Android powered smartphone named HTC Dream.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Google published it&#8217;s operating system Android as free and open source project thus anyone can build thier own custom version of Android with different skin or features etc due to that almost all mobile companies who were unable to use closed source iOS started loading and shipping thier smartphones with Android as it&#8217;s one and only operating system at that time has potential and capability to compete with iPhone iOS.</p>
<p>Android quickly reached heights which now has more then 70% world wide market share as it&#8217;s smartphones are less expensive thus preffered and liked in almost all countries mainly in developing nations then comes iPhone iOS which has less then 25% world wide market share as it&#8217;s expensive most people don&#8217;t want to buy it in developing countries but in developed countries like USA it has more then 50% market share now.</p>
<p>In case of Microsoft back in year 2010 they released Windows Phone with thier own closed source mobile operating system which was buyed by some people who don&#8217;t prefer neither Android or iOS for whatever reasons so after that Microsoft released number of Windows Phones even powered up Nokia Lumia smartphones but both of them eventually failed because of several reasons to name few Windows phones doesn&#8217;t have enough apps and was insufficient in many areas thus it was unable to beat Android and iOS as well.</p>
<p>Windows Phone 10 is last smartphone released from Microsoft in year 2015 and software updates discontinued in year 2017 since then Microsoft didn&#8217;t released any new Windows Phones and they fully diverted thier focus to PCs but still alot of people want to buy Microsoft Windows who may have to buy old Windows Phones from some offline or offline stores as new ones are mostly unavailable now.</p>
<p>There may be many reasons why you insisting to buy Windows Phones may be you&#8217;re an collector trying to preserve old technologies or for nostalgia reasons which is fine but if you want to buy Windows Phone to play it&#8217;s exclusive games then it&#8217;s not worthy as now you can play Windows Phone games on Android smartphones using WPR Emulator.</p>
<p>Usually, emulator softwares available for Android or iOS in common support to play home video game console or computer operating systems but this WPR emulator is something new and exciting as it allows you to play Windows Phone games on any Android smartphones which is definitely amazing as majority of Android users may never ever thought about it for sure.</p>
<p>It is not possible to directly run Windows Phone games on Android due to hardware and software differences and limitations which is why emulators are developed in supported digital format using number of compatible programming languages then implement hardware or convert software of Windows Phone in emulator software which can&#8217;t be done easily.</p>
<p>The working structure and digital mechanism of emulators is they provide an inside virtual digital environment of Windows Phone hardware or software basically Virtual box or operating system that we now use on daily basis where you can sideload and install compatible Windows Phone games like Virtual box or operating system that we use every day.</p>
<p>Now, we have almost all are unofficial emulators developed by third party developers who usually not partnered or connected with companies which is why they won&#8217;t get any assistance and have to work themselves to create almost all files from scratch then do regular degugging and testing at atmost care as reported by users while using software or playing Windows mobile games which is quite hard and take time that&#8217;s why emulator softwares for long time like years stay in early or alpha access phase.</p>
<p>Third party developers smartly from past decade to progress and fast-track the development of emulators publishing thier emulator source code as FOSS aka free and open source via public repositores on contributive development platforms like GitHub and GitLab etc where anyone can register and commit code to optimise and improve emulator by adding or removing options and features due to that we are getting quicker stable releases.</p>
<p>FOSS emulators source code is public thus anyone can use it to build thier own custom version of emulator applying thier own extra necessary optimisations and enhancements to improve emulator because of that we got number of official and unofficial ports or we can say custom clients for PCs for smartphones and vice versa which further rapidly developing emulators at fast pace.</p>
<p>PCs support more emulators then smartphones as they have powerful hardware and software which is why majority of developers try to make unofficial emulators for smartphones due to it&#8217;s compatibility and ability to run any heavy resources games at high fps rate but they are also giving enough spotlight and concentration on smartphones</p>
<p>Smartphones don&#8217;t support some emulators of PC mainly those that are developed for modern hardware and software systems PC due to so much incompatibility but as manufacturers for commercial reasons constantly upgrading smartphones and third party developers also working to bring more emulators for smarphones due to that we get support for them soon in near future.</p>
<p>Anyhow, if you want to play Windows Phone games on Android then right now there is one world&#8217;s first WPR Emulator which is currently in Alpha phase and only support some Windows Phone games but in future it may get stable versions with more support of Windows Phone games.</p>
<p>Note : WPR Emulator is still in Alpha access phase which means development is in progress so you may find bugs or limited number of features but eventually WPR emulator may fix all issues and release more interesting and exciting features in future, so do we got your attention? are you interested in WPR Emulator? if yes let&#8217;s explore more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/how-to-install-vs-code-visual-studio-code-on-android-phone.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/how-to-install-vs-code-visual-studio-code-on-android-phone.webp" width="400" alt="how-to-install-vs-code-visual-studio-code-on-android-phone"></a></p>
<p>When smartphones didn&#8217;t existed computers are the only devices that are available to people since decades even now computers usually have more powerful hardware and software then smartphones including that computers have millions of softwares that are more capable and advanced then smartphones.</p>
<p>Now a days, majority of people switched to smartphones as you can do almost all works of PC on smartphones in its own way but there are some functions and softwares of computers that are not available on smartphones like for instance you can directly install computer softwares on smartphone mobile operating systems due to different hardware and software limitations.</p>
<p>Even though, now we have computer emulators like Limbo and ExaGear by using them you can install computer operating systems and softwares on smartphones yet they are slow and can only Install limited softwares so people not showing much interest on computer emulators instead they opting to cloud softwares and desktop operating systems like OnWorks and Never Install.</p>

<p>However, most people don&#8217;t know except Geeks there is another way to install deskop apps on smartphones using Termux unbelievable right? but it&#8217;s possible even though you can&#8217;t run all desktop apps on smartphone using yet Termux can install majority of computer operating systems and softwares.</p>
<p>Recently, we found some commands to install and run VS Code aka Visual Studio Code a popular desktop software released by Microsoft on November 18, 2015 which is very popular and reliable software that is used by majority of developers to code, view code and debug softwares etc.</p>
<p>There are numerous mobile VS Code apps available for smartphones but still desktop VS Code is more powerful and capable thus if you want complete IDE software for professional usages then VS Code is right choice and fortunately you can also run VS code on smartphones using Termux.</p>
<p>Note : You can use the commands we provided below on PC or cloud platforms like Google Cloud as well to install VS code but there is nothing special in installing VS code on PC or cloud platforms because they already have in-built desktop software support thus we are installing VS code on Android powered smartphones using mobile Linux environment terminal emulator Termux.</p>
<p>We have few alternatives to Termux like ConnectBot, Better Terminal Emulator Pro etc but Termux is most popular and reliable one thus we are going to use Termux to install desktop VS Code software on Android OS, so do you like? are you interested? If yes let&#8217;s let&#8217;s begin.</p>
<p><strong>• How to download Termux •</strong></p>
<p>It is very easy to download Termux from these platforms for free.</p>

<p>Cloud gaming is popular in many developed countries especially in united states but in india majority of people even gamers don&#8217;t know about cloud gaming platforms as right now people are more busy with FPS games such as PUBG and call of duty etc but eventually cloud gaming will be the future of world.</p>
<p>Since, the entry of smartphones in mobile market drastically reduced the usage of PC and gaming consoles as now a days majority of people using modern and advanced smartphones to play high graphic games but hardware that you get on smartphones is not powerful enough to support PC and home console games due to different hardware and software limitations.</p>
<p>However, by using cloud technology you can stream and play almost all PC and PS5 games on smartphones using cloud gaming platforms even though most cloud gaming platforms aren&#8217;t free and not available in india yet we recently found one of the best and reliable cloud gaming platform from Nvidia named GeForce now.</p>
<p>Nvidia is well known powerful GPU aka graphical proccesing unit manufacturer for regular and gaming PCs but recently on Feb 4, 2020 they launched GeForce now a cloud gaming platform for Android powered smartphones to play 1000s of popular and amazing PC and PS5 games absolutely for free.</p>
<p>But, in order to play PC or PS5 games without glitches and lags over cloud on Android using Nvidia GeForce now, you need high speed internet atleast 10 mbps connection as the quality of cloud stream is totally depended on your internet speed so just make sure you have good network with budget or high end smartphone.</p>
<p>Even though, Nvidia GPUs available in many countries yet for whatever reason Nividia GeForce Now cloud gaming platform is only available in few countries like USA so incase you want to try Nvidia from India then it won&#8217;t work as it&#8217;s not supported but we can use Nvidia GeForce now in unsupported countries using VPN by connecting to any USA server.</p>
<p>We have numerous free and paid VPNs which provide USA servers yet alot of them actually won&#8217;t work and detectable by Nvidia GeForce but there is this VPN named Windscribe by using that you can connect to numerous USA servers and and start using Nvidia GeForce now.</p>
<p>Note : on Nvidia GeForce cloud gaming platform there is only one free plan by using that you will get 1 hour cloud gaming session with basic rig and standard access to gaming server so incase you want more then 1 hour cloud gaming session then you have to buy paid plans, so do you like it? are you interested in Nvidia GeForce? If yes let&#8217;s know little more info before we explore more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/how-to-install-blender-on-android-using-exagear-emulator.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/how-to-install-blender-on-android-using-exagear-emulator.webp" alt="how-to-install-blender-on-android-using-exagear-emulator" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>For 100s of years we limited ourselfs and thoroughly enjoyed 2D movies then eventually we got 3D movies which look super real and cool for marvelous experience, that&#8217;s why most film production companies stepping in 3D films business even though world first 3D movie power of love is created in 1922 yet only after James cameron Avatar in 2009 3D technology got immense popularity.</p>
<p>However, 3D animes and cartoons are more popular then 3D movies as we seen number of 3D animes and cartoons since 1980s and 1990s who can forget first 3D full length animated film Toy Story ( 1995 ) by Pixar Inc founded by Steve Jobs which is still in continuation due to it&#8217;s super popularity and whopping financial success.</p>
<p>Toy Story and Avatar shown the full potential of 3D technology to world and become inspiration to many companies and individuals so eventually we got see alot of amazing 3D content but not many people know inorder to make 3D movies and cartoons or animes you should have 3D development software that costs alot of money like Cinema 4D, Maya Etc.</p>
<p>3D films require powerful hardware and software for processing and development so most 3D animation companies use very advanced and super fast PC with their own propieratary software that is not available to general public usage thus most people pay for 3D development software which will work absolutely fantastic.</p>
<p>Most 3D development softwares available for desktops has paid subscription thus you can only use them when you pay and get license so newbies and people who are new to 3D development usually don&#8217;t like to spend money on paid softwares as they are still in learning phase eventually newbies will start using free and open source 3D development softwares.</p>
<p>Few decades back, people used to have only paid and proprietary 3D development softwares to make 3D movies and animations that are normally not accessible to public and really expensive so in this scenario to provide 3D developement software to everyone Ton Roosendaal a dutch software developer and film producer created free and open source Blender foundation in year Jan 2, 1994.</p>
<p>Blender is very basic and not even comparable to paid 3D developers softwares in the beginnings but over the years thanks to being open source on GitHub 3D animators and developers around the world contributed alot to progress Blender to such stage that now we can say Blender has everything to do all works and compete with paid 3D development softwares.</p>
<p>Even though, Blender is comparable to paid 3D development softwares yet as big and high production value companies like Disney and Pixar spend billions of dollors in development of thier own 3D softwares so they may have better and exclusive features to increase efficiency of 3D development in company campus but this doesn&#8217;t mean Blender is no match for paid 3D development softwares.</p>
<p>Anyhow, After the launch of Steve Jobs revolutionary Apple&#8217;s iPhone 1 multi-touch advanced and modern smartphone in 2007 that shocked whole world since then companies started manufacturing powerful smartphones that are capable to most works of PC and eventually people shifted and started using smartphones over desktops.</p>
<p>In 21st century, people no more showing Interest in buying desktops like pc or laptop as they can do almost anything from smartphone itself but there are alot of things that a smartphone is not capable of like running big heavy resources cpu and ram required sofwares so at present smartphones hardware is not powerful enough to render 3D movies and animes etc that&#8217;s why 3D development softwares officially not available for smartphones.</p>
<p>But, the demand to install 3D development softwares like Blender on smartphones is super high even though mobile operating systems are not compatible to run PC software on smartphones due to different hardware and software with full system limitations still we searched for a method to install PC softwares on Google&#8217;s Android mobile operating system and fortunately we found ExaGear Emulator.</p>
<p>Majority of people don&#8217;t know that most Emulators that are available on internet are unofficial thus installing videos games or operating systems on such Emulators is illegal as you are running pirated version of video games or operating systems but people still like to use Emulators as they are feel super cool and interesting.</p>
<p>We have number of emulators like PPSSPP and Lemuroid etc to play video games and operating systems on desktop and smartphone but few years back people thought it&#8217;s not possible to emulate desktop operating systems and install PC softwares on smartphones then suddenly Limbo and ExaGear Emulator appeared on internet that can run desktop operating systems and install desktop softwares on Android smartphones for free.</p>
<p>Emulators are unofficial and created by third party developers who don&#8217;t get any support from companies as emulators can install and run thier gaming consoles or operating systems which will decrease sells of thier existing products so most developers has to go through alot of things to make software and hardware compatibile Emulator and that takes alot of hardwork and time even if Emulator is open source still they stay at early access phase for years until they become stable for ex : Citra 3ds Emulator.</p>
<p>ExaGear by Eltechs developed a open source Emulator to run PC softwares on Android powered smartphones by using that you can install 3D development softwares like blender but don&#8217;t expect ExaGear Emulator to run big softwares and games because very likely you may not even able to install and open them due to compatibility issues.</p>
<p>There are several emulators alternative to install PC softwares on smartphones still right now ExaGear Emulator is considered as popular and best choice but ExaGear is discontinued in 2019 and that will not stop you from installing PC softwares because you can old versions to install PC software on Android using ExaGear Emulator, so do you like it? are you ready to explore more? If yes let&#8217;s get started.</p>

<p>Windows, a popular desktop operating system developed by Microsoft founder William Henry Gates III on Nov 20, 1985 who is well known as world richest man from 1995 to 2017 until he was surpassed by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, anyway you may probably know most computers or laptobs available out there on market are pre-loaded with Windows OS right?</p>
<p>Since, 1980s Windows GUI aka graphical user interface desktop operating system dominated PC market even though some people prefer Linux while Apple Mac OS does give tough competition to Microsoft Windows OS over the years still Windows is considered as best desktop operating system because you just have to pay few dollors to own licensed Windows that can be booted on any desktop pc or laptop.</p>
<p>Windows OS officially only support and available for desktops and now a days majority of desktop users install pirate unlicensed Windows operating system that is illegal and unsafe as some times pirated Windows OS software may contain spyware or undetectable malware or virus that damage your desktop so it is always better and safer to install licensed version of Windows operating system for security and privacy.</p>
<p>Anyhow, Windows OS is undoubtedly one of the best desktop operating system to do almost anything with millions of softwares but after the entry of advanced and powerful hand-held smartphones in mobile market most people especially Millennials and Gen-Z started shifting to smartphones as they are compatible and user friendly thanks to mobile operating systems like Android and iOS etc.</p>
<p>In 21st century, we have modern and latest smartphones equipped with powerful hardware and advanced mobile operating systems which are capable to do most works of desktops operating systems but some works require desktop hardware and software to run heavy resources cpu and ram insensitive softwares thus people still depended on desktops.</p>
<p>However, Windows pre-loaded desktops costs more then regular smartphone and at present most people don&#8217;t have interest to buy and use desktop operating systems as they are able to do almost anything on smartphones because of regular software updates and upgrades with simultaneous rapid development to not only provide new and futuristic features but also to improve user experience.</p>
<p>Eventhough, you can&#8217;t directly boot desktop Windows operating system on smartphones due to different hardware and software with system limitations yet it is  possible to install desktop.operating system on Android powered smartphones using Limbo emulator by using that you can run fastest Windows 10 VM &#8211; virtual machine without lag on Android for free.</p>
<p>Few years back, emulation of desktop and mobile operating systems on mobiles is impossible even thought we have video game console Emulators like PPSSSPP, Lemuroid etc but later on we luckily got some Emulators like Limbo to actually create virtual machines of any operating system with different settings in ease.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.techtracker.in/2022/05/how-to-install-windows-softwares-on.html" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">+ How to install Windows softwares on Android using ExaGear Emulator.</a></strong></p>
<p>Limbo is currently the best open source Emulator by properly settings it up you can boot almost any operating system but on Limbo Emulator you may face glitches or little lags while running most operating systems especially Windows as Limbo is still in continuous development phase to optimize further and give improved whole new experience in upcoming versions.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re familiar with software development then you may probably know running deskop operating systems on Android is once near to impossible task as companies like Microsoft or Apple don&#8217;t develop and release thier desktop operating systems on smartphones because it will impact and drop sells of thier existing desktop products.</p>
<p>So, it is evident developement of desktop emulator for Android is very hard task and takes atleast few years for talented and skilled developers to make it stable due to lack of support from companies, that&#8217;s why most emulators for Android even being open source on GitHub or GitLab stay at early access phase for long time.</p>
<p>Anyway, we recently found a ported fastest Windows 10 which is in .qcow2 format file but you can also use other formats like .vhd or legacy Windowa formats like .iso that you can load and run on Limbo Emulator then use VNC viewer to connect and use without lags, so do you like it? are you ready to explore more? If yes let&#8217;s begin.</p>

<p>There are several mobile operating systems available for smartphones but Android from search engine giant Google  is most popular one with big market share around the world as it&#8217;s open source most mobile companies pre-installing Android over other operating systems like iOS, FirefoxOS, Symbian, Java etc.</p>
<p>However, Apple&#8217;s iOS is more secure because of closed operating system but iOS is not customizable like Android thus many iOS users switch to Android or like to install Android on Apple&#8217;s iOS but it is near to impossible as both are based on different software and hardware.</p>
<p>Now a days, most people buying big ram and rom Android powered smartphones but some users for whatever reason still use old smartphones that has low storage and memory thus they are unable to play big games and run apps and to fix that problem majority of users buy SD cards or pendrive etc but there is an easy way to fix this using cloud technologies.</p>
<p>Recently, we found a platform named LD Cloud by using that you can run Android on cloud 24/7 with numerous features on Android and iOS powered smartphones but on free plan you only get 2 hours upon expire you have to upgrade, isn&#8217;t amazing? If yes let&#8217;s know little more info before we explore more.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[On PC, you can easily edit system level files and use softwares [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/why-you-should-root-your-android-smartphone.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/why-you-should-root-your-android-smartphone.webp" width="400" alt="why-you-should-root-your-android-smartphone"></a></p>
<p>On PC, you can easily edit system level files and use softwares as superuser by clicking on run as administrator but on Android in order to edit system level files and run apps as superuser you have to install rooting softwares after unlocking bootloader which voids warranty</p>
<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/1_why-you-should-root-your-android-smartphone.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/1_why-you-should-root-your-android-smartphone.webp" width="400" alt="1_why-you-should-root-your-android-smartphone"></a></p>
<p><strong>&#8211; XDA &#8211;</strong></p>
<p>Rooting Android is not new developers especially geeks used to root Android software since the launch of Android smartphones using different rooting softwares and methods, thankfully when  the tested rooting method for Android is successful they create guide and share it on portals like XDA.</p>
<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2_why-you-should-root-your-android-smartphone.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2_why-you-should-root-your-android-smartphone.webp" width="400" alt="2_why-you-should-root-your-android-smartphone"></a></p>
<p><strong>&#8211; SUPERSU AND MAGISK &#8211;</strong></p>
<p>We have numerous Android rooting softwares out there on internet but the most popular one is Supersu by chainfire which supports majority of Android smartphones but chainfire discontinued Supersu in 2018 and then we got modern rooting software named Magisk from developer john wu with advanced features from then Magisk become one stop destination to root any latest smartphones.</p>
<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/3_why-you-should-root-your-android-smartphone.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/3_why-you-should-root-your-android-smartphone.webp" width="400" alt="3_why-you-should-root-your-android-smartphone"></a></p>
<p><strong>&#8211; READ / WRITE SYSTEM FILES &#8211;</strong></p>
<p>There are many advantages by Rooting Android but the main one is you can access and edit system aka root level files to customize, remove or add your own features that are not available including that you can also add and remove even sharing system level files is possible.</p>
<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/4_why-you-should-root-your-android-smartphone.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/4_why-you-should-root-your-android-smartphone.webp" width="400" alt="4_why-you-should-root-your-android-smartphone"></a></p>
<p><strong>&#8211; REMOVE OEM APPS &#8211;</strong></p>
<p>Android is open source project aka AOSP developed by Google thus anyone can build thier own version of Android and use it on thier smartphones so most mobile companies install Android software on it&#8217;s smartphones including thier own apps as system so that you can&#8217;t uninstall them which occupy alot of storage and many people consider them as bloatware.</p>
<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/5_why-you-should-root-your-android-smartphone.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/5_why-you-should-root-your-android-smartphone.webp" width="400" alt="5_why-you-should-root-your-android-smartphone"></a></p>
<p><strong>&#8211; ROOT FOLDER &#8211;</strong></p>
<p>If you want to uninstall unnecessary system apps aka bloatware then you must have to root your Android smartphone and then simply use any file manager you like I suggest Mixplorer to open /root folder where you can easily access and remove system apps in one click.</p>
<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/6_why-you-should-root-your-android-smartphone.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/6_why-you-should-root-your-android-smartphone.webp" width="400" alt="6_why-you-should-root-your-android-smartphone"></a></p>
<p>But, remember make sure you don&#8217;t remove such system apps that are required and directly connected to software, if you accidentally or mistakenly remove any key functionality system apps which are needed by Android device to work properly then it will hard or soft brick your smartphone which is irreparable sometimes.</p>
<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/7_why-you-should-root-your-android-smartphone.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/7_why-you-should-root-your-android-smartphone.webp" width="400" alt="7_why-you-should-root-your-android-smartphone"></a></p>
<p><strong>&#8211; SUBSTRATUM &#8211;</strong></p>
<p>Even though many custom skinned Android softwares like MiUI and HiOS etc allows you to install custom themes without root yet incase if you&#8217;re using pixel smartphones or stock roms then by rooting Android you can install cool and amazing custom themes via theming engines like Substratum.</p>
<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/8_why-you-should-root-your-android-smartphone.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/8_why-you-should-root-your-android-smartphone.webp" width="400" alt="8_why-you-should-root-your-android-smartphone"></a></p>
<p><strong>&#8211; MODULES &#8211;</strong></p>
<p>You can also install modules by rooting Android to customize or get new features, on your smartphone now a days most people using Magisk modules but the problem with Magisk is it&#8217;s repository is discontinued so you have to search and get modules from internet to install on Magisk manager, anyhow there are many popular module repositories alternative to Magisk like Xposed, LSposed etc.</p>
<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/9_why-you-should-root-your-android-smartphone.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/9_why-you-should-root-your-android-smartphone.webp" width="400" alt="9_why-you-should-root-your-android-smartphone"></a></p>
<p><strong>&#8211; SOUND MODS &#8211;</strong></p>
<p>One of the major prospect of rooting Android is It is possible to tweak, enhance and increase headphones and speaker sound by just installing modules or rooted apps, even you can install Sony Dolby Atmos on any Android smartphone which is normally only available on Sony and partnered smartphones.</p>
<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/10_why-you-should-root-your-android-smartphone.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/10_why-you-should-root-your-android-smartphone.webp" width="400" alt="10_why-you-should-root-your-android-smartphone"></a></p>
<p><strong>• RUN ROOT APPS &#8211; </strong></p>
<p>Foremost, many users root Android to install that apps which only work on rooted smartphones to name a few for instance busybox to install tiny unix utlilites, Battery Guru or Greenify to increase an optimize battery life, App2SD Pro to increase system storage aka ROM or RAM by swaping SD card, performance tweakers, app backups etc.</p>
<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/11_why-you-should-root-your-android-smartphone.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/11_why-you-should-root-your-android-smartphone.webp" width="400" alt="11_why-you-should-root-your-android-smartphone"></a></p>
<p><strong>&#8211; CPU / GPU &#8211;</strong></p>
<p>While, some users and developers root Android to increase CPU and GPU mhz to increase performance and play games at better FPS but modifying CPU and GPU is very risky as if you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re doing then in long run your CPU and GPU will become slow and become not usable, anyhow you can change CPU and GPU as well but always set it at safe levels.</p>
<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/12_why-you-should-root-your-android-smartphone.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/12_why-you-should-root-your-android-smartphone.webp" width="400" alt="12_why-you-should-root-your-android-smartphone"></a></p>
<p><strong>&#8211; DEBUG APPS &#8211;</strong></p>
<p>Especially, developers root Android devices to debug and test apps or softwares to find out bugs as on rooted Android devices you can edit system files, modify app data as per requirements anytime which is not possible on non-rooted Android so if you don&#8217;t want to root Android then they have to depend on PC or Android studio.</p>
<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/13_why-you-should-root-your-android-smartphone.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/13_why-you-should-root-your-android-smartphone.webp" width="400" alt="13_why-you-should-root-your-android-smartphone"></a></p>
<p><strong>&#8211; GOOGLE CAMERA &#8211;</strong></p>
<p>Google camera aka GCam you may probably heard of it&#8217;s a camera app developed specifically for Google&#8217;s pixel smartphones which is not available on other smartphones but thanks to amazing developers who first struggled to port Gcam to other devices but over the time it is now possible to install on any rooted Android smartphone by simply enabling camera 2 Api.</p>
<p>GCam uses it&#8217;s own software algorithm to drastically increase picture quality even if the camera hardware is not top notch, now with Gcam ports and mods from talented developers around the world we can experience Google camera exclusive features like super nightmode, potriats, astrophotography etc on any Android smartphone, isn&#8217;t this cool and awesome?</p>
<p>Finally, This are just few valid reasons why you should root your Android device but anyway it&#8217;s up to you, what do you think? do you support rooting? have you rooted your Android smartphone? do say your opinion why you want root your Android device is in our comment section below, see ya 🙂</p>

<p>Rooting Android does give you access to system level files which you can modify or edit to customize and get new features on your Android smartphone, but getting root level access aka superuser on Android not only compromise security and privacy but also give easy access to hackers to inject malwares, virus etc at root level thus they can surveillance or snatch personal data without your permission.</p>
<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2_why-you-shouldnt-root-your-android-smartphone.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2_why-you-shouldnt-root-your-android-smartphone.webp" alt="2_why-you-shouldnt-root-your-android-smartphone" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>There are many reasons why people root thier Android smartphones, but the main one is because of smartphone companies as they stop providing latest software and security updates after 1 or 2 years on old smartphones, thus users who don&#8217;t want to buy new smartphones root Android to get latest features.</p>
<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/3_why-you-shouldnt-root-your-android-smartphone.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/3_why-you-shouldnt-root-your-android-smartphone.webp" alt="3_why-you-shouldnt-root-your-android-smartphone" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s ok to root your spare old Android smartphone where you don&#8217;t store your personal data but it&#8217;s better to avoid rooting your new smartphone where you keep your personal data as once you root your new smartphone it will unlock root level access, so if you visit or install any malicious payload website or app due to root level access on your smartphone it will be easy for hackers to exploit and hijack your smartphone.</p>
<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/4_why-you-shouldnt-root-your-android-smartphone.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/4_why-you-shouldnt-root-your-android-smartphone.webp" alt="4_why-you-shouldnt-root-your-android-smartphone" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>Usually, most banking and payment apps won&#8217;t work on rooted Android devices as they know rooted Android smartphones doesn&#8217;t have much security thus hackers can take your device under thier control to illegally transfer your funds anonymously which will lead to financial losses,</p>
<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/5_why-you-shouldnt-root-your-android-smartphone.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/5_why-you-shouldnt-root-your-android-smartphone.webp" alt="5_why-you-shouldnt-root-your-android-smartphone" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a person who use banking apps on Android then it&#8217;s always better to stay away from rooting to keep your funds safe but this doesn&#8217;t mean hackers can&#8217;t hijack non-rooted smartphones as they are many methods to hack non-rooted smartphones as well but non-rooted Android devices are not easy to hack due to device encryption and restriction to root level files, unless they use law enforcements spyware.</p>
<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/6_why-you-shouldnt-root-your-android-smartphone.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/6_why-you-shouldnt-root-your-android-smartphone.webp" alt="6_why-you-shouldnt-root-your-android-smartphone" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>Anyhow, one shouldn&#8217;t root Android smartphone without knowledge as if you incorrectly edit or modify any root level file then it will soft or hard brick your Android smartphone which is irreparable including that rooting is not easy as first you have to unlock bootloader of your device in order to root using guides specifically created for your device from portals like <a href="http://xda.com/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">XDA</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/7_why-you-shouldnt-root-your-android-smartphone.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/7_why-you-shouldnt-root-your-android-smartphone.webp" alt="7_why-you-shouldnt-root-your-android-smartphone" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>Rooting also voids warranty as most smartphone companies clearly mention this on thier manual booklets, once you root Android smartphone you can&#8217;t claim warranty for both hardware and software damages occurred on your smartphone under 1 or 2 years warranty period.</p>
<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/8_why-you-shouldnt-root-your-android-smartphone.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/8_why-you-shouldnt-root-your-android-smartphone.webp" alt="8_why-you-shouldnt-root-your-android-smartphone" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>Majority of users who root Android don&#8217;t increase or customize CPU cores but alot of geeks and low proccessor device users increase CPU and GPU cores and change it&#8217;s giga hertz to increase performance of device, but the problem with CPU and GPU increase is they put alot of strain on CPU cores so eventually your Android device become slow even not usable over time.</p>
<p>Finally, This are just few valid reasons why you shouldn&#8217;t root your Android device but anyway it&#8217;s up to you, what do you think? do you support rooting? have you rooted your Android smartphone? do say your opinion why rooting Android device is harmful in our comment section below, see ya 🙂</p>

<p>Magisk is a software for Android rooting, when well known Android rooting software SuperSu by Chainfire Team announced the end of it&#8217;s development, developer john wu created and introduced Magisk, from then Magisk is considered as best replacement and alternative to not only SuperSu but for other Android rooting softwares as well.</p>
<p>Magisk is advanced Android rooting software which gone through alot of advancements over the years to provide most useful and amazing features, thanks to John Wu for such commitment, effort and hardwork on Magisk to provide one stop rooting solution for Android users.</p>
<p>Magisk has ability to pass Safetynet of Google, hide root, install magisk modules like Xposed modules, grant root access aka superuser access to apps and ADB and many more, however when John Wu the creator of Magisk got full time job at Google&#8217;s Android security team he has to discontinue support for MagiskHide for various reasons.</p>
<p>MagiskHide is popular and most useful feature of Magisk to hide device root and run that apps which won&#8217;t work on rooted Android devices, unfortunately the fact is official support for MagiskHide come to an end, so people have no choice other then look for alternative and thankly we have riru and shimiko to do the job.</p>
<p>Eventhough, John Wu tweeted that MagiskHide has flaws but stlll MagiskHide is working and effective method to hide root from various types of detections,  anyway John Wu eventually worked on new features on Magisk named Zygote, Zydisk and DenyList which can be used to only hide root for apps not device.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why, people especially geeks like and prefer MagiskHide feature but it&#8217;s not available on latest Magisk releases, so they limit themselves and use Zygisk which is daemon of zygote and DenyList to run apps which won&#8217;t work on rooted android devices, anyhow many people don&#8217;t know MagiskHide is still alive on custom Magisk.</p>
<p>Magisk is open source software which means developers can use it&#8217;s repository to make thier own version of Magisk, we recently found a developer named TheHitman7 who created a custom magisk where MagiskHide still exists which you can use to hide root of device and apps easily, isn&#8217;t this awesome? If yes let&#8217;s know little more info to explore more.</p>

<p>Note : Magisk is a Android rooting software to gain root access aka superuser control on your android device, so first you have to unlock bootloader and then boot custom recovery like TWRP and install custom rom which is created only for your device using specific guides from portals like XDA, incase you already done all this then you are ready to install custom Magisk but remember you shouldn&#8217;t install custom Magisk on existing stable or official magisk builds.</p>
