										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/neo-wellbeing-a-foss-alternative-to-google-digital-wellbeing.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/neo-wellbeing-a-foss-alternative-to-google-digital-wellbeing.webp" alt="neo-wellbeing-a-foss-alternative-to-google-digital-wellbeing" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>Doing things at right time and at right place is what make your life organised right? Many people right from the day on plan when and what things should be done next isn&#8217;t it? so far we know thanks to a lot of scientific studies time is flexible and it moves slow and fast based on it&#8217;s place, like for instance time travels slow in space and on some planets in comparison to the planet earth, including that time also travel slow when you move and go fast at super high speeds, if you&#8217;ve read Albert Einstein time dilation theory then you may probably know it&#8217;s fascinating concept, isn&#8217;t it? Like that there is another popular &amp; interesting theory known as time travelling with time machine that basically state we can go to past or future in time, many people say it&#8217;s baseless and not possible, but there are a lot of people who believe that it&#8217;s possible as there is nothing impossible in this quite magical super natural universe, yet we are not sure but one thing is clear as per logic if we rely upon scientific research then it provides many theories which confirm that we may not be able to travel to past but we can definitely travel to future, for example : if we go for a space ride at light speed for like few years and return back to the earth then you may find you&#8217;re younger than the other people at your age at the same time more than twice or thrice time already got passed on earth like shown in Interstellar movie, in sense we may likely can&#8217;t travel to past and uncertain about future, so we can&#8217;t change things happened in past and we can&#8217;t control things which are going to happen in future, so why to worry about anything? At the end living in present time and scheduling plans for the future is what matters most isn&#8217;t it? and that&#8217;s why time is precious? so wise don&#8217;t waste time.</p>
<p>If you waste your time or not? That&#8217;s up to you, but in one way or another you&#8217;ll be part of someone else time, as time is omni present and it&#8217;s everywhere for everyone isn&#8217;t it? for example: let&#8217;s say you simply stay still like rock and doesn&#8217;t do anything in the time but things around you may not do the same, and they may do whatever they want in time, including that you may somehow directly or indirectly get effected or impacted by it like for instance let&#8217;s say you may want sunny day or you may want some fruit fall down from tree instantly, will it come or fall instantly or at exact time you want? Definitely not isn&#8217;t? They will come or fall when time comes right? So you can&#8217;t do anything except accept the timings of them, basically things may not always go as you plan instead they may go by the things around you, for example to understand better let&#8217;s say you planted a seed and want it to become tree or you call some bird out of nowhere and want it to come instantly, will it happen? Nope it will very likely not, as being a human being you lack the command to control the other beings actions and time, though you may with intervention somehow can make the things go as you plan upto certain extent but not entirely &amp; not all the time, because things will only happen if they themselves want and at their own desired time, so due to that in one way or another you will be involved in someone else time and you have to go as per their time and scheduled plans thus they will do the same for you, in simple if you respect time then mutually it will do same to you, and acknowledge the fact change is part of time, for instance let&#8217;s say air may be slow at certain time in someplace but the very next minute it may change, if you understand what&#8217;s time and how it will work, then you&#8217;ll able to better manage and adapt to time pretty well.</p>
<p>Time is eternal and ever lasting one, at present scientific studies didn&#8217;t found a place where there is no time, basically if you feel something then there is time without that there will be nothing but will there be nothing? even if it is that nothing will be something, time is super natural which on it&#8217;s own didn&#8217;t provide any kind of formulas to calculate it except the fact you can feel it&#8217;s presence, thanks to that over the years many smart human beings have developed numerous formulas to calculate time, due to that eventually now as per our convenience we are able to calculate time in seconds, minutes, hours, days, years, decades, centuries, millennium and so on, including that they were further divided like 60 milliseconds = 1 second and 60 seconds = 1 minute, 60 minutes = 1 hour, 24 hours = 1 day, 7 days = week, 30 days = 1 month, 12 months / 365 days = 1 year, 10 years = 1 decade, 10 decades = 1 century, and 10 centuries = 1 millenium etc so that will be able to calculate and feel time better and accurately, majority of people around the world from past number of centuries calculating and feeling time as per them except animals and other beings, they have their own formulas and senses to calculate time, at the end when majority of people calculate and feel time that way then you being a individual who depended on others may have to go in that track as well, else you will be left behind which is not good if you want to adapt and live in harmony with them universally.</p>
<p>In sense, people basically designed their own mind framework and formulas to calculate time in order to check, arrange, understand, do whatever things they want and go on in time conveniently, back in ancient times people as per their own understanding and comfort created many different frameworks to calculate time including that though primitive they even created numerous different types of clocks and calenders to understand and track past gone and upcoming time mostly calculated based on earth rotation around planet sun and moon, as it&#8217;s more ideal than anything else because human beings relied on them for light / dark immensely, in detailed half rotation of earth which is in direction with the sun provide sunlight on earth and other half of earth which is in direction with the moon provide darkness on earth, while light and dark since ages are essential for survival and livelihood of human beings, eventually human beings named earth rotation phases timelines accordingly, however due to lack of proper knowledge back then calculation of time and earth rotation time phases used to be little inaccurate, but later on as time goes we got to see high tech tools, scientific studies, advanced mathematics and technologies due to that we are able to calculate time and earth rotation phase timelines accurately and efficiently.</p>
<p>There used to be number of calenders over the years created by ancients with their own different types of frameworks and formulas to calculate time, which are mostly based on earth rotation around sun or moon known as solar and lunar cycles, out of them most calenders were little bit in-accurate somewhere but as time goes many intellectuals developed and found many different better ways to calculate time thanks to them eventually we got to see way better and accurate calenders like Gregorian which in modern times we along with clocks utilising worldwide to track the past gone and upcoming timelines, in the solar cycle based Gregorian calendar we find naming for the earth rotation phases timelines categorized into days, months, years including that Gregorian calender also calculated to have 365 days per year which was widely accepted, confirmed and approved to be legit and accurate by the latest scientific research studies, which is why now a days we use it extensively isn&#8217;t it? though Gregorian calendar can be used globally but it&#8217;s not everything because it only tracks the days, months and years not the actual live time, we use the Gregorian calendar in conjunction with 24 hours per day yet still it doesn&#8217;t track the live time right? as said earlier time changes based on speed and place, so calender is not the right tool to calculate live time, instead we have to rely on different types of clocks.</p>
<p>On planet earth people reside in different parts around the world right? While earth rotates eastwards as it rotates different parts of earth are exposed to sun or moon at various intervals basically that&#8217;s what we call earth rotation phases timelines, because of that earth and people get to experience many different light and dark conditions, people to use in daily life have named all earth rotation phases timelines like morning, afternoon, evening, night etc, including that many intellectuals over the years created many timezones based on earth rotation to precise calculate time in certain part of earth including that based on the time zones we got clocks thanks to them, now people around world were able to collaborate and function together very well, at first people used to rely on rock or sun and moon shadow clocks but as time goes eventually we got mechanical analog clocks and now in modern times we have digital clocks which are way advanced and better than existing ones, now a days most people using analog clocks in par with the digital clocks balancedly as analog clocks are still in wide usage and have potential to be continued in future as well, anyway in analog or digital clocks we commonly use 12 hour format ante meridiem and post meridiem for general purposes in home, office, private and public outlets etc including that we also use 24 hour format mostly in military, aviation, trains, science, medicine, emergency services etc, which time format are you using right now?</p>
<p>You use any format time, but thing is very clear considering various factors in review, digital clocks are usually more flexible and feature packed than regular analog clocks thanks to embedded digital technologies, in the beginning stage digital clocks used to be basic but as time goes due to a lot of updates and upgrades they&#8217;ve became pro, in sense at present we have such digital clocks in them you will be able to calculate time extensively like ability to check all the timezones, stop watch, set timer, alarm etc including that as digital clocks are digital basically software they can be included in any digital electronic devices, though we have regular wall and wrist digital clocks and on many electronic devices will find digital clocks like on television, keypad mobiles, refrigerators, radio etc yet thing is some of them are basic and mainly big in size and not quite portable as well, which is why majority of people around the world now instead utilize modern and portable smartphones and smartwatches in them, people can not just check time but also do a lot of things on the go using apps, but the problem here is sometimes a lot of people due to whatever reasons lost track on how much time they&#8217;ve been spend on smartphones which is not good as unable to track and mis-managing the time spend on smartphones and smartwatches can cause trouble to you, even harmful and overtime it can be quite addictive that can lead to psychological or any other health issues, that&#8217;s something you don&#8217;t want to let happen right? If so then you may glad to know now a days most smartphones &amp; smartwatches operating systems inbuild integrated with tools to track the time that you&#8217;ve spend on smartphones everyday.</p>
<p>Google Digital Wellbeing is one such top widely used tool, by using it you&#8217;ll be able to better manage, focus and track the time that you&#8217;ve spend on smartphones and smartwatches created and integrated by search engine giant Google on their own Android powered smartphones and smartwatches though Google is well known conglomerate that created and launched many revolutionary and reliable products trusted by millions yet there are certain percentage of people who don&#8217;t like to use Google Digital Wellbeing mainly because it&#8217;s closed source software which can be concerning as the problem with closed source softwares is their code is usually encrypted and private due to that you won&#8217;t know what&#8217;s hidden in private encrypted code unless you can decode and decrypt it which is difficult and can be done only by skilled developer Including that some developers even encrypt code with virus, malware, malicious trackers, spywares, RAT aka remote adminstration tools etc and hide them well, which are sometimes not even detectable by some antivirus softwares or experts, using such closed source softwares can be risky as they can cause damage to your device privacy and security, so to solve this big issue in recent years we got to see a lot of people and geeks stopped using closed source softwares instead craving for free and open source softwares aka FOSS.</p>
<p>Recently, we got to know about an feature rich FOSS alternative to Google digital Wellbeing named Neo Wellbeing, which is still in early access phase but what matters most is it&#8217;s free and open source, the benefits of using FOSS is their code is usually made public available as repository project on contributive development platforms like GitHub or GitLab etc, as FOSS provide transparency of code due to that anyone online can check and review repository projects to find errors, faults, violations, security, legitimacy, authencity of code thanks to that when using foss projects you&#8217;ll get much better security and privacy thus you&#8217;ll stay in safe zone at the same time foss projects usually also allow anyone to commit and contribute code to fastrack development of project so that you&#8217;ll get faster updates and upgrades including that foss projects also allow anyone to fork code so that people can develop their own custom version of them with their own removed or added external options, features, and optimizations etc, at the end foss projects are way flexible and provide much better experience than the closed source ones for sure, so do you like it? Are you interested in foss projects like Neo Wellbeing? If yes then let&#8217;s explore more.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Value, each and everything that you see and touch around you has [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/paynav-now-get-digital-gold-every-time-you-shop-offline-or-online.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/paynav-now-get-digital-gold-every-time-you-shop-offline-or-online.webp" alt="paynav-now-get-digital-gold-every-time-you-shop-offline-or-online" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>Value, each and everything that you see and touch around you has unique value isn&#8217;t it? usually value of things change from each and every individual being right? as giving value or valuation to something is basically pyschological thing that&#8217;s quite unique and different to each and every one so due to pyschology some people tend to give more value to something which is not given value by some other people and vice versa, as it&#8217;s based on their requirements and many other factors mainly how they see that something because not everyone is capable enough to understand as well as estimate value of thing, in sense some people find value in everything and some people don&#8217;t find value in everything, at the end in mind of people value of plethora of things available in this massive universe will keep on changing from time to time as it&#8217;s pyschological, which is why something that&#8217;s quite highly valuable in the past may not have value in future and vice versa.</p>
<p>Generally, if we look at things with broad mind then will get to know, everything in this universe has immeasurable value but due to various different reasons and purposes, living beings in this universe. according to time, as said earlier based on their psychology and usage needs given certain estimated value to things they are aware off, and then created and found many ways to express value of things like through actions, drawings, words, sounds shapes, numbers like for example: let&#8217;s say there is a object, if we show that object to someone and ask value of that object then that person may express value of it either through actions like bodily movements &amp; signs, or drawings like arts, paintings etc, or sounds like spoken and hearable ones, or words and numbers either vocal or written ones, or shapes like rectangle, square and traingle, etc, isn&#8217;t it? Thought actions, drawings, words, sounds, shapes are widely used by majority of people most of the time to express value but numbers ranks on top which are quite heavily used to express value of things worldwide.</p>
<p>Even though, as said earlier everything on this universe has immeasurable value, but to be more specific in this context due to unique psychology, value on something usually changes from each and every individual being due to that a individual may give high value to something and another individual may give less value, in sense each and every individual being due to their unique psychological mind give their own certain value to each and every existing specific thing like for example : let&#8217;s say there is a pen which is being selled for 10$, but one buyer may find it&#8217;s value more than 10$, and another buyer may find it&#8217;s value lower like 5$, it is also possible there may be many buyers who find the value way lower like 3$ even if they have more necessity than the fellow buyers, in sense though requirement play pivotal role in increasing value of thing but not all the time, there are numerous other psychologically driven factors which play quite important role in increasing as well as decreasing value of things primarily like level of requirement, interest, attraction etc that&#8217;s why most of the time will very likely find atleast slightest point difference of valuation between set of individuals and groups etc as valuation is psychological it is volatile in nature as valuation is unique to each being it can change anytime.</p>
<p>But, there are certain things available in this universe which large percentage of people on planet earth unanimously give more value to them like gold, silver and diamonds etc mainly known to be found on planet earth, they are rare objects and hard to find which is why since ancient times they&#8217;ve been given immense value by a lot of people, in sense many human beings thought have unique psychology yet have one thing in common which is basically to give more value to rare and hard to find and get things, because of that metals like gold, silver and rocks like diamonds, platinum etc got quite huge prominence and at one point back in time gold, silver and diamonds even replaced barter system, in sense people used to exchange things for things but eventually people started exchanging gold, silver and diamonds to buy things from each other due to that eventually they&#8217;ve become mode of payment and considered as money, but the problem here is as time goes gold, silver, diamonds become more rare due to that value of them increased exponentially and they&#8217;ve became quite expensive so many people started to think buying gold, silver and diamonds as good investment and started to believe having them is like status symbol, due to huge demand worldwide they can be selled anytime thanks to that they even worked as security in time of financial set backs globally, isn&#8217;t that pretty amazing?</p>
<p>However, though for long time gold, silver, and diamonds as they were being highly valued by large percentage around the world due to that they&#8217;ve worked pretty well as mode of payment, but there are some usage hardships and drawbacks with them like for instance, foremost thought gold, silver, diamonds can be shaped to any size and shape but thing is gold, silver, diamonds are not readily available as they are rare and it&#8217;s hard to find and get them mainly because they are available under earth, so in order to get huge quantities of them large workforce have to mine for long time with quite big machines and technologies which all are expensive stuff and things to do, so even if some mining companies somehow were able to extract huge quantities of them still at the end there will be difficulties in maintaining and using them in the real world, like primarily making and storing them is super hard &amp; expensive including that in reality especially in this era utilzing them is inconvenient as they are heavy to carry and exchanging in big numbers can be problematic which is why to suit to the current modern era financial dynamics, governments introduced paper money also known as fiat &amp; cash currency which is easy to make, store and light weight as well thanks to that eventually paper aka fiat currency replaced and also working as an alternative to gold, silver, diamonds as money and mode of payment from past few centuries worldwide effectively.</p>
<p>In sense, paper money aka fiat currency is readily available as paper is made from wood, it is recyclable as well thanks to that governments will have to spend very less money in comparison to mining to make paper money including that as paper is basically plain sheet on that governments can simply print any value they want due to that a simple paper that commercially has little value will get immense value in real world just because it has big value printed on it and that was authorized by government entity, paper money was big deal back in early era when it was for the first time got introduced to public by many modern governments, but now all this is may be pretty normal thing yet the fact is emergence of paper money is fascinating and quite beneficial to society in number of ways isn&#8217;t? for instance as paper weight is small, lite weight, slick people were able to easily store in small space, carry and exchange them on their own and were also able to deposit &amp; withdraw huge amounts from banks on the go conveniently around the world, anyhow though paper money does have many benefits at the same time it has drawbacks as well like to name few as paper money is wood based physical material it is destroyable, not traceable and can be duplicated by anyone with right tools &amp; skills, such practices will increase money laundering, corruption, and black money which has negative impacts on society, that&#8217;s why good governments and people since long time wanted an better alternative to paper currency to utilize as money, thanks to the efforts of a lot of intellectuals eventually after few centuries, in early 20th century we got to see digital money which governments were able to track and keep things in check for a safe, regulated and legal money usage in this world including that people were able to way simply and quickly utilize the digital money with the help of digital as well as electronic technologies comfortably.</p>
<p>Digital revolution paved way for digital money, in emergence and opting to many revolutionary digital technologies mainly internet, operating systems and application softwares etc with right electronic technologies like mobiles, computers, desktops in place to use them, the dream of digital money came true in 90s era and it&#8217;s usage grown exponentially in 20th &amp; 21st century, though technically digital money as it&#8217;s basically digital code that you can see on digital screen is different from paper money but certain digital money&#8217;s provided by number of platforms can be somehow converted to paper money, for example : banks will only provide digital money when in backend you have paper money got deposited in your bank account by you or bank itself, which means digital money basically work as face and have connection with actual paper money, but there can be also many digital money&#8217;s which have no relation to fiat money and will work autonomously, anyway thanks to many governments who in co-ordination with central bank have recognized and legalized digital money including that regulated and controlled public and private banks in adapting to trend and concept of digital money eco- system at the same time governments and banks in order to level up usage of digital money together developed and offered necessary platforms and services for people to utilize digital money in real world like ATMs and banking apps etc integrated with bunch of digital technologies to make domestic &amp; international money transfers around the clock quickly and efficiently but thing is at the end digital money has pros and cons just like paper money, when it comes to pros as digital money is digital as long as you have compatible electronic device and internet to view it you can get, check, &amp; use digital anywhere and anytime, including that as digital money is basically a digital number it has digital size which is so tiny that even trillions of digital numbers can be saved in few kb &#8211; kilobyte storage because of that any value digital money can be simply sent and received instantly using internet or any wired or wireless technologies due to that without moving anywhere you&#8217;ll be able to send and receive digital money globally including that if the digital currency is provided by banks then transactions by users are recorded and if required can be in supervision of the state governments or law enforcement agencies to keep things in check, reduce and stop illegal and fraud money transfers and practices so that only white money gets into picture and people will use money safely and legally but the pros of digital money comes with it&#8217;s cons for instance as digital money is basically technology, even with strict security measures still there is always chance of loop holes which can be exploited by hackers to get access to anyone digital money and simply theft it or do anything without trace anonymously including that digital money provided by banks are centralized and guarded by in build private technologies, so there is no transparency due to that owners of digital money won&#8217;t know what and how banks are doing under the hood with their private personal data and digital money, which is concerning for many people, that&#8217;s why a lot of them wanted an better alternative to digital money provided by banks with transparency, better security, privacy with complete ownership of digital money and no reliance on any centralized institutions like banks, as there is such requirement to supply back in year 2009 we got to see new digital money known as crypto.</p>
<p>Crypto currency is basically digital money aka currency, but it is not provided by governments or banks instead they are usually created and provided by non-government entities, crypto is basically decentralized currency which doesn&#8217;t rely on centralized institutions like banks instead it has it&#8217;s own decentralized infrastructure to provide users of crypto with top notch transparency by providing full information basically being free and open source about all of it&#8217;s underlying technologies, and transactions of users will be recorded in blockchain explorers that ensures whatever transactions are happening in crypto ecosystem are real and validated by crypto technologies, including that most crypto currencies also provide best possible security to it&#8217;s users and whatever transactions happening in it&#8217;s ecosystem, by providing encrypted and secured crypto wallets for users to store their crypto currency which are locked using backup phrase until or unless a person has that no one will able to open crypto wallet including that most crypto currencies networks usually utilze proof of stake system in that set of miners will solve block of codes using their own computer power in order to verify each transaction for that they&#8217;ll receive crypto rewards and also this procedure verify each transaction thus it ensures each and every transaction is tamper proof that provides security including that crypto currency also provide immense privacy to users like by not making it essential for user to provide personal details to register and use crypto wallets including that all the transactions recorded in blockchain will not have personal details of sender or reciever that ensures anonymity of users, It is all possible because decentralization is core concept of crypto currency and it&#8217;s quite rooted in all it&#8217;s open and underlying technologies isn&#8217;t that fantastic which is why since the inception of crypto currency a lot of people mainly geeks who want an alternative to fiat currency &amp; regular digital money started exploring and investing in revolutionary crypto currency networks.</p>
<p>The start of crypto currencies began when psuedonymous satoshi nakamoto created world&#8217;s first revolutionary decentralized crypto currency named bitcoin back in year 2009 which is created to replace mediators like banks and provide way better robust digital currency that provides transparency, security, privacy, anonymity for people, back in the beginning bitcoin doesn&#8217;t have much value as creator wanted organic growth of product thanks to that gradually day by day bitcoin attracted investors around the world to level that it&#8217;s value skyrocketed making a lot of early bitcoin investors networth millions and billions, after that eventually the huge hype and potential surrounded around the bitcoin driven it to get huge fanbase and it&#8217;s underlying ecosytem and technologies inspired many developers to build their own amazing crypto currency networks like solana, ethereum, matrix etc, alternative to Bitcoin, but thing is at the end crypto currencies are considered as asset just like gold, silver, diamonds etc as they have their own value which just like any other asset their value get increased when demand is high and get decreased when demand is low, though fiat currency can also be considered as an asset due to it&#8217;s rise and fall of value overtime but not the reliable one as fiat currency is limited to specific state or country which value is based on issuing country government and their economy conditions with face value in global stage basically fiat currency not have universal value, while cryptos does, and they being decentralized can bypass censorship so they can&#8217;t be restricted or limited by anyone but there&#8217;s a catch all crypto currencies are not legally approved, audited neither recognized by government so there is always risk when dealing with crypto currencies and relying on them is like walking on unstable bridge, yet still demand for crypto currencies is growing up mainly due to it&#8217;s huge returns and associated path breaking technologies but there can be big losess as well which is why having or utilizing bitcoin with high expectations is not ideal instead utilize cryptos carefully to be in safe zone.</p>
<p>Robert Kiyosaki, well known co-writer of popular financial related selling book &#8220;Rich Dad, Poor Dad, who also authored many other financial related books, emphasized many times if you want your money back then investing in assets like gold, silver, land, cattle as best for long term over in stock market, as they are more reliable due to their universal stable value, while stock market can crash anytime which is evident in history, though big crashes in stock market is quite normal in every few decades but still what if bad aliens landed on earth and wipe out all stuff which are core and essential to run stock market? If not aliens something else who knows? So there is always high risk in stock market and it&#8217;s not the safe option for thoso who can&#8217;t take risk and adventure into stock market, for people with low financial risk appetite gold, silver, diamonds, land, home, cattle etc are best on go choices because they may have slow growth in value but it&#8217;s steady and they&#8217;ll have pretty high value in future mainly gold, silver, diamonds due to their rarity, while home, land and cattle are required and became necesisty for most people so value of them very likely may not get nullified around the world.</p>
<p>In india, since ancient times mainly gold next comes silver, diamonds have pretty high significance which are not just seen as status symbol but also they are quite deeply rooted in land culture, traditions, religions, and among many communities, due to that buying or wearing mainly gold on certain occassations or days are quite special and considered by many as lucky and auspicious including that many indian families in india have custom and tradition to pass gold and other valuable items to next generations which is why demand for gold and then silver, diamonds etc since long time persists in india, but thing is like many countries utilizing gold as mode of payment and money has been taken over by paper money in modern era, there may be certain percentage of people who still using gold, silver and diamonds as mode of payment but most people in india and around the world has shifted to fiat paper money to do almost all transactions, so considering decades long usage and the advantages of paper money, gold atleast for few decades upcoming may not be able to replace paper money, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>Anyhow, though as said above gold, silver, and diamonds etc may not very soon replace fiat paper money but they are always in usage as alternative to fiat paper money, thanks to their universal high value most people if given option to choose between them and fiat money, majority of people like to have gold, silver, diamonds over fiat paper money, but unfortunately people in a lot of platforms primarily have to must use paper fiat money to buy things or receive and get paid for anything, due to that at the end considering the reliance on paper fiat money in current financial world, most people have to externally buy and receive or get paid gold, silver, diamonds from certain dedicated platforms or by using fiat paper money and then store them somewhere to use them later for various purposes, in sense a lot of people viewing gold, silver, diamonds as backup money including that when gold, silver, diamonds value raise up, in need many people selling gold, silver, diamonds in exchange of paper fiat money, which all seems fine isn&#8217;t it? But thing is not all people were able to afford gold, silver and diamonds as they are now quite expensive which is why a lot of people somehow and find various ways, work to get gold, silver, diamonds into their personal treasure.</p>
<p>There are numerous ways to get gold, silver, diamonds primarily through mining, if lucky enough then it&#8217;s easy but normally extracting gold, silver, diamonds from underground is expensive so most people instead buy gold, silver and diamonds from sellers in exchange of their fiat money, but thing is as said earlier there are a lot of people who can&#8217;t and unable to afford gold, silver, diamonds due to lack of sufficient paper fiat money including that there are certain percentage of people who even being able to afford gold, silver, diamonds still don&#8217;t want to directly buy them instead want to somehow get them through other ways like as rewards or freebies, for instance through exchange of valuable items like utensils and properties for gold, silver, diamonds, or win them through certain competitions, or even get them as bonus like by extracting from certain items like electronics, including that that are certain sellers who offer some amount of gold, silver, diamonds and other valuable things as bonus for purchasing or utilizing their products or services etc, isn&#8217;t that pretty amazing!</p>
<p>Now a days, in view of digital technologies, a lot of physical things have been digitalized for the convenience, easyness, and comfort of public, in progress of that we got to see digital gold, which from past decade got huge popularity around the world as it&#8217;s way easy to buy and transfer in few clicks, technically digital gold is actually same as physical gold but the only difference is digital gold usually have to be purchased from online outlets through web platforms like shopping, stock and banking apps etc, when a person purchase digital gold from registered and licensed platform then they according to the quantity and other factors convert digital gold into physical gold and store them in secured lockers including that the person who owns digital gold can exchange digital gold for physical gold as well, thanks to the benefits of digital gold many people purchasing digital gold with fiat, digital, crypto currency but thing is there are certain percentage of people who don&#8217;t want to directly purchase digital gold instead somehow get and earn digital gold for free as rewards, bonus for doing activities like completing of tasks, playing games, shopping online etc, as there are such people for them in recent years we got to see number of digital platforms who seems to provide digital gold rewards.</p>
<p>Recently, we got to know about an feature rich interesting digital platform named PayNav, a P2P investment platform in partnership with RBI-approved NBFC and processed by P2P asset partner Lendbox providing upto 30% cashback basically 24K digital gold as reward for shopping online in india at over 500+ online popular stores like Amazon, Bigbasket, Zivame, Flipkart, Swiggy, Zomato, Makemytrip, Uber, Shoppers Stop, Westside, Croma, Tanishq etc including that through PayNav in-store you can enjoy special deals and cashback at over top 1000 food outlets and stores to choose like including KFC, Barbeque Nation, Mainland China, Third wave Coffee, Starbucks, Spar, More, Bookmyshow, Shoppers Stop, Chumbak, Max Raymond, Bata, Pantaloons, Vmart, Tbz, PVR Cinemas, Apollo Pharmacy, Puma, Bata, Sketchers, Body Shop, Health &amp; Glow, Himalaya, Croma, Natures Basket, Spencer&#8217;s, Decathlon and more!, at the end you can withdraw your digital gold rewards as cash or physical gold coins, it&#8217;s not just that PayNav also offers upto 9.5% interest on savings account with debit card and portfolio insurance on the go, ain&#8217;t all this seems worthy? there may be many more things coming up from PayNav in future, so do you like it? are you interested in PayNav? if yes let&#8217;s explore more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/studiovity-ultimate-tool-to-organize-your-film-making-workflow-on-the-go.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/studiovity-ultimate-tool-to-organize-your-film-making-workflow-on-the-go.webp" width="400" alt="studiovity-ultimate-tool-to-organize-your-film-making-workflow-on-the-go"></a></p>
<p>From silent black and white films to 4k+ resolution ultra high defination 10bit films, as time goes thanks to evolution of many technologies over the years due to them film production came a long way, in sense we got to see timely emergence of many revolutionary technologies over the years in each and every era, in the process of adapting and utilizing them the way film makers make and show films to viewers changed accordingly for the benefit of them and audience including that many technologies over the years directly or indirectly increased market value of film industry around the world which now in 21st century digital era worth billions of dollars, as there is huge market value and reach for films globally, many companies and individuals for passion or to somehow get benefitted from films investing a lot of money in producing and releasing of films, mainly to generate profitable revenue, due to that over the years we got to see many big budget films out of them some are hit and some are flops at the box office.</p>
<p>In sense, since long time many companies and individuals willing to spend a lot of money in producing films as there is huge scope and potential to them, when films are in public domain they can impact people around the world in various different ways based on genre and content of film like inspire, motivate, educate, spread awareness, horrify, laugh, influence and many more, while makers can show, promote, advertise, whatever they want in films to get desired return outcomes like response, engagement, fame and generate revenue from viewers as additional bonus etc, so basically at the end both makers as well as viewers have mutual benefit in context of films, which is why global film industry continuously rising up and evolving to new levels constantly for the benefit of all, in the process over past few decades we got to see different modes and names in publication of films based on their medium and run time like movies, cinemas, web series, tv shows, short films, and serials, etc isn&#8217;t that interesting?</p>
<p>Films are basically medium to share visual content in that sound content can be added to present way better and detailed information and experience to watching audience, people through films can share content filled with information related to anything, thought there are many people who get into film industry primarily see it as worthy tool to only make big sum money, but at the same time thanks to impact of films from past few centuries around the world due to that in the back end there are a lot of people who primarly get into film industry not for money but only for their passion towards films in order to mainly show off their talent and skills, knowledge, craftsmanship etc in  form of actors, actresses, directors, producers, technicians etc, at the end undoubtedly because of combination of both money and passion minded people, film industry growing well else it wouldn&#8217;t as lacking any of them will result in poor performance of film industry globally.</p>
<p>If there is passion then the maker can create good quality content films but without money it&#8217;s hard for maker to create rich content films as making certain films need big budget to get desired outcome, as rich film making is expensive, makers rely on big investors basically producers to full-fill their budget requirements in order to make films, for suppose if producer is not money minded then producer may not invest and manage making of film well in right direction to get desired output and drive film to generate profits which can result in financial losses that can lead to bankruptcy and eventually may trouble producer career in film industry, at the same time in parallel if the maker like director don&#8217;t have passion in making of film then even if there is big budget for film still output quality of film will be poor which is not beneficial for producer, maker, audience, so it eventually may trouble, maker career in film industry as well which is why money minded and passionate people in balance proportions for sure necessary in any film industry.</p>
<p>Even though, if there is only money mindset in producer and only passion in maker then as said earlier it works but in reverse it may not work well as for producer having only passion is not enough at the same time for maker having only money mindset is not enough in the execution and making of film, due to their different working structure and end result goals, but having both money mindset and passion in producer and maker in context of films then it is considered as fabulous combo as such people may work more unitedly in making of film and drive it in right direction and get best possible quality output of film, which is why makers wish to have money mindset passionate producers and vice versa, thought money is not always driving force for certain percentage of passionate producers and makers, but money as reward to efforts can give required boost and work as an 360% shield on the maker in society which give self reliability, confidence and better life etc due to that they will be able to perform better in making of films and maker may continuously try to improvize the craft to get more and more rewards in form of money or anything else worthy.</p>
<p>However, it doesn&#8217;t always mean if there is money minded passionate producer and maker then whatever film they made will be successful, as only making of film will be in control of them, and once film got released and it&#8217;s available in public domain then the success of film is determined by how many people watched, liked and rated film and how well film in short and long run performed at the box office basically collections, which is why since the early days of films, majority of producers and makers used to spend a lot of money and time in advertising and promoting their films so that their films will reach to more people worldwide, thought if film really have potential content then it will get organic reach but still if possible doing advertisements and promotions for film is beneficial for sure, because sometimes for whatever reasons even good films don&#8217;t get reach organically, that&#8217;s why as maker despite your film turned out good or bad in your view still spreading the word of your film as much as possible at your best in your decided budget and capacity is quite important and necessary because now a days a lot of films release ever day around the world and there is huge competition in film industry, due to that if your film have low budget and it&#8217;s not good enough then it&#8217;s difficult &#038; hard for film to get enough limelight, so it&#8217;s better to spread the word of your film since the start of film making to attract audience so that after release of film you may get to see audience already waiting to see your film quite eagerly.</p>
<p>Camera, do you know what exactly is it? You may probably do isn&#8217;t? If you&#8217;re watching films that&#8217;s because we have cameras as films are basically recorded physical, electronic, digital foot print of real life thing captured using camera, In the early era camera used to be basic and theatres used to be only medium for films to show them to audience but eventually as time goes due to the evolution of technologies and demand for much better cameras and mediums for films, in that process in each decade we got to see new type of cameras and mediums to show various types of films like 2D, 3D, 4D, etc, and by 20th century we got to see super cool powerful and advanced professional modern DSLR cinema cameras to capture films vividly and amazing mediums to show films to audience like mult-plexes, television, home theatres, computers and mainly smartphones thanks to them a lot of people were able to capture, show and see films conveniently at their comfort zone easily and efficiently on the go.</p>
<p>The latest camera and medium technologies to capture and show films have increased reach of films to audience quite effectively, thanks to efforts of inventors and films makers in utilizing them for the mutual benefit of them and people around the world, at present film industry is big deal, many people have dreams and work hard to get into and make career in film industry, back in early 19th century due to basic cameras and only medium is theatres to show films, it used to be hard and difficult to get into film industry but now in this modern digital era we have super high quality cameras and awesome electronic as well as digital technologies at palm of your hands in form of smartphones which are available at cheapest price in market, due to that even the person who have poor financial condition if have potential and smart skills may somehow get into film industry and may make sensational films for sure.</p>
<p>If you are an aspiring film maker and already in the making of films, then you may probably know film making is big process and from start to finish has to be done carefully like from writing of script, direction, cinematography, photography, dance, music, costumes, editing and pre production etc, there is a lot of stuff behind the making of films, so they have to be managed well right? Back in early era of films people used to remember or write whatever things necessary for films on paper notes but now in this digital age we have fantastic softwares by using them you can manage making stuff of films easily isn&#8217;t that amazing? There are many film making stuff management softwares out of them we recently got to know about an all in one solution comprehensive film pre-production management or you may call companion app named Studiovity for smartphones, so do you like it? are you interested? If yes let&#8217;s explore more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/owlfiles-powerful-file-manager-for-cloud-servers-storages-etc.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/owlfiles-powerful-file-manager-for-cloud-servers-storages-etc.webp" alt="owlfiles-powerful-file-manager-for-cloud-servers-storages-etc" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>Anything, around you which you see, touch and use doesn&#8217;t exist without space right? we scientifically don&#8217;t yet know how much space is available in this universe, but we humans were able to use whatever space available to us according to our needs in whichever way possible accordingly, to store or move things in space area right? living beings mainly humans since they came into existence utilized whatever space available to their reach in whichever way possible extensively by making boundaries in order to do constructive operations, for example : people not just occupied space on earth by themselves, but also created new things out of existing ones to occupy more space at the same time created their own many different type and layout structure on existing space for various purposes like for instance in form of homes, stores, underground basements, tunnels and pipes etc, isn&#8217;t that right?</p>
<p>In sense, space is basically empty area that can be occupiable by things, which distance, height, width is measurable thanks to our formulas and calculations, so based on that we can build layout on top of space with things to add boundaries and then occupy and use accordingly, for example to understand better let&#8217;s say there is 10 miles of empty space, if it can be seen and accessible then you may able to measure it by yourself or with external technologies and based on it&#8217;s coverage area you can divide by adding boundaries on top of it inside already existing space boundaries to see or do desired things, in simple if you draw or build square, traingle or rectangle etc shaped lines or structure basically build layout on top of space then whatever space radius inside of lines or structure basically layout can be occupied till it&#8217;s limits set by boundaries so that as per your requirements you may be able to better manage existing space on go.</p>
<p>If we say space then it must have boundaries as without it we can&#8217;t call it as space, basically space is determined by it&#8217;s boundaries so if the space you have has square shaped layout boundaries then whatever things you want to put or move inside of space area has to be placed and settled as per it&#8217;s boundaries, for example : let&#8217;s say there is traingle shaped layout boundaries on top of space due to that inside space will have traingle shaped radius, in simple if there is traingle shaped layout on top of space and if you stuff some material on space radius inside of traingle shaped layout boundaries to it&#8217;s max limit then whatever materials that you stuffed inside of space radius will be limited to it&#8217;s boundaries due to that whatever stuffed materials inside space radius will simply form shape of traingle, but that will only happen when traingle shaped layout boundaries are stiff and have capability to hold whatever stuffed materials inside space radius well.</p>
<p>But, thing is when whatever stuffed material inside the space radius of traingle or any other shaped layout boundaries is more then limits of space radius then it can break layout boundaries, there after stuffed material may go out of it&#8217;s space radius and material may loose it&#8217;s shape, which is why when building layout on top of space, it&#8217;s important to take care of layout design, material and technologies as per your requirements well to get the desired outcome else it may go wrong, like for example : if we take any shape rubber balloon and fill it with air, water or any other material then the rubber balloon can expand 5 times bigger then it&#8217;s original size as rubber material is elastic in nature isn&#8217;t it? but if we take a paper balloon and fill with same materials in same quantity of rubber balloon, will it be able to hold and expand size? Definitely not right? As paper material is made by wood which is usually not elastic in nature due to that when you stuff some material in paper balloon more then it&#8217;s space radius and holding capacity limits, then the paper balloon material layout boundaries will break and whatever stuffed material that was inside of paper balloon may go out of it&#8217;s position or loose it&#8217;s shape for sure.</p>
<p>The space radius size inside of layout boundaries is as important as the layout material type and it&#8217;s quality as the bigger the size of space radius in 360°, the more things you&#8217;ll be able to put and move inside of space radius, which is why if you have bigger things to manage then you may need sufficient large space radius inside of layout boundaries else managing things can become bit difficult and you may eventually have to found much bigger space radius for sure, for example : let&#8217;s say there is like 10 meters distance space with only 5 meters height and width in that scenario you have a pole which height is 10 meters and you want put that in stand in posture on 5 metre height space radius, Will you be able to do it? It&#8217;s not possible isn&#8217;t it? As the space radius which we have has insufficient height space radius, but in that situation we may instead able to fit up pole in flat position as per the distance of space radius right? That&#8217;s why at the end you have to choose and get space radius and it&#8217;s layout structure boundaries as per your needs as well as the shape and size of things to manage space effectively.</p>
<p>When you have sufficient space radius, you&#8217;ll be able to store and manage things quite conveniently, if you do not have sufficient space radius you&#8217;ll get space shortage issues which makes it difficult and hard even impossible to store and manage certain things which are bigger than size of your space radius, that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s always important to have enough space radius else you may struggle and face issues to do things later in future, anyway as said earlier there are different types of space but the one that we said above is physical one which is visible that you can simply feel and see with your eyes isn&#8217;t it? when you build layout boundaries on top of space and then from outside of layout boundaries, will you be able to see and check space radius? It&#8217;s not possible isn&#8217;t it? unless the layout that we build on the top of space is transparent right? If it&#8217;s not then you have to manually go inside of layout boundaries to see, check, manage things available on your space radius.</p>
<p>You may think it&#8217;s no big deal to enter inside of layout boundaries to see things available on space radius, it may be not if space radius is small in size but if it&#8217;s large then it will be pretty difficult to see and track them which is why if you&#8217;re someone who for whatever reasons or purposes have to check space radius regularly then it&#8217;s better to have transparent layout boundaries, if you don&#8217;t have still you&#8217;ll be able to check and manage space radius using certain tools and technologies that we build over the years specifically for this like by noting placements and names of things available on space radius so that when you enter space radius the very next time you will be able to find them quickly and then comes high tech robots and live surveillance cameras by using them you will not only able to check and keep track of things available on your space radius but also move, destroy, damage, change, modify and transform things efficiently.</p>
<p>We as said earlier there are different types of space isn&#8217;t it? The above one which we discussed is about physical space that you may feel and see around you, now we got our basics about space, so now in the context of this article, let&#8217;s move on to digital space which has some features and characteristics of physical space but it is in digital form so you can&#8217;t directly feel or see it instead many supported electronic devices like personal computers, PDAs, smartphones etc were able to feel, detect, access, and see digital space provided in various electronic technology products like memory cards, pendrives, HDDs, SDDs etc when connected to them so by utilising such electronic devices, you can simply access and experience the digital space but wait it will be not like physical space, you can&#8217;t directly view, occupy and do anything on digital space radius even if digital space providing electronic product is openly transparent in physical space.</p>
<p>Even though, technically digital space is also part and is on top of physical space but we can say digital space is different or parallel universe inside of physical space with it&#8217;s own nature, environment, limits, controls, capacity and technologies etc, digital space at present is only able to store digital format files, at the end digital space and anything thing that occupies it usually will be in binary format which will be in two digits 0, 1, 1,0 that humans can&#8217;t translate which is why we use electronic devices, they can read and understand binary format and convert it to human readable format so that you will be able to better manage digital space well, but wait you can&#8217;t simply right out access and see digital space by connecting it&#8217;s providing gadget to electronic device instead you have to use softwares developed using programming languages like C++, Java, Python, Go etc as bridge to connect and do anything on digital space, gotcha?</p>
<p>Softwares are also digital things which are stored in digital space, but when executed they by using necessary device drivers and hardware technologies will act as layer of bridge between electronic device and digital space to show you everything about digital space and whatever digital things occupied it&#8217;s digital space radius vividly, the softwares which let you connect, access, view and do anything on your digital space from electronic devices are popularly known as file managers and file explorers, thought we already have a lot of file managers available for most electronic devices but finding quite right best and advanced file manager for smartphone can be challenging task for sure isn&#8217;t it? If you are looking out for some pretty good file manager for smartphone then you&#8217;re now at right place, recently we got to know about amazing feature rich file manager named Owl Files for smartphones that not just let you connect with your device local digital space but also access network shares, cloud servers and cloud storages etc, so do you like it? are you interested in Owl Files? If yes then let&#8217;s explore more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/lspatch-now-run-xposed-modules-without-root-on-android-devices.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/lspatch-now-run-xposed-modules-without-root-on-android-devices.webp" width="400" alt="lspatch-now-run-xposed-modules-without-root-on-android-devices"></a></p>
<p>CyanogenMod have you ever heard of this custom rom? If you&#8217;re into Android stuff  since long time then you may probably do isn&#8217;t it? CyanogenMod is basically once up on a time most popular and top Android custom rom used by like millions of people, it used to provide a lot of pretty amazing customizations and features through custom roms for number of years of various Android versions for a lot of devices, which are usually not available on stock Android builds released by Google and many other device makers aka OEMs isn&#8217;t that cool? due to such awesomeness of CyanogenMod it not just inspired many third party developers around the world to build their own Android custom roms but also made them to use CyanogenMod as base for majority of custom roms due to that the fanbase and tech community of CyanogenMod grown exponentially to the level that back in year 2016 well known big india&#8217;s mobile maker company Micromax partnered with CyanogenMod to release it&#8217;s Yu Yuphoria series smartphones with CyanogenMod thanks to that Micromax Yu smartphone series recieved quite enough attention and sells in market, but thing is later on CyanogenMod was discontinued by it&#8217;s team due to some internal conflicts within Cyanogen Inc., yet thankfully many members in order to revive Cyanogenmod have contributed to develop and launch it&#8217;s fabulous sucessor named LineageOS.</p>
<p>LineageOS like it&#8217;s predecessor CyanogenMod is an foss aka free and open source software, but thing is it&#8217;s not customization oriented custom rom instead it focused on minimal useful changes and kept things original as possible, thanks to that many people and third party developers who like to use and make stock Android custom roms started using LineageOS as base, due to that now it received huge userbase and considered as one of the best custom roms available for Android devices, but thing is not everyone like to use pure stock Android like custom roms isn&#8217;t it? there are certain percentage of people who instead want and prefer to utilize extensive feature rich customizable custom roms, thought there are many of them, but at the end it&#8217;s quite difficult to integrate each and everything in one right? which is why many third party developers cherry pick features from different stock as well as custom roms to add and build their own custom roms as they want and for users around the world accordingly so that users can choose and switch custom roms as per needs easily.</p>
<p>Even though, since long time we have thousands of super cool feature rich custom roms integrated with modern technologies, which can be installed on any compatible hardware Android devices simply through adb fastboot or custom recoveries like TWRP, but thing is at the end for whatever reason there&#8217;s chance custom roms may didn&#8217;t satisfy in one way or another isn&#8217;t it? like for instance you may be felt stock OEM roms are much better than most custom roms in terms of better performance and usability right? In anycase pure stock Android roms doesn&#8217;t provide things which you&#8217;ll get on custom roms, so if you&#8217;re someone who is unable to use custom roms, but still want to get and can&#8217;t get over with customizations and features of custom roms then since long time main thing and alternative to custom roms we have is to root Android devices using softwares like Chainfire SuperSu or Magisk etc, they&#8217;ll provide write access to system partition so that you will be able to do core system level changes on Android as you like to get desired output and do almost all things extensively on the go.</p>
<p>However, thought rooting Android devices is pretty easy task as all you have to do is basically unlock device bootloader and then you can simply even root it without PC using one click root mobile apps like  Kingoroot or Framaroot etc, but thing is in order to customize and add features on Android devices you either have to be a skilled developer or person with well knowledge on structure of Android else you may hard or softbrick devices which is sometimes irreparable, so if you&#8217;re newbie then it&#8217;s better to stay out of it or deal root system level things carefully on Android to be in safe zone, as it can mess up things severely instead you can use root apps, thanks to many third party developers who over the years already made and released many root apps for various purposes to not just customize and get new features on Android but also do a lot more stuff like change user interface or get dolby atmos and digital surround sound etc isn&#8217;t that fabulous? At the end there is no doubt we have a lot of fantastic root apps and tools, but the one that mesmerized and not just changed the way users customize and get new features on Android device but also leveled up them is Xposed Framework.</p>
<p>Xposed Framework is basically free and open source root app for Android devices created by XDA recognized developer Rovo89 back in early rise of Android era, since the beginning of Xposed Framework it received huge userbase and over the years got immense popularity among Android users thanks to it&#8217;s functionalities, Xposed Framework has many interesting and useful modules build by third party developers around the world, when you use Xposed Framework with modules they&#8217;ll inject certain code directly into selected and enabled Android system or users apps, so that you can not only just lock or unlock stuff to enable or disable restrictions and things on Android devices, but also you will be able to customize and get new features effectively, which is why Xposed Framework has long been must have root app on Android devices.</p>
<p>Usually, as time goes technologies keep on evolving as per requirements and needs of market as people usually want and expect more out of their products same goes for Xposed Framework, even thought it&#8217;s in initial stage itself is pretty good one, yet evolution to next level as per demand of users is necessary to cope up and stay up-to-date in market accordingly  which is necessary, that&#8217;s why Rovo89 allowed anyone to make and provide their own forms of Xposed Framework so that people can use it quite more efficiently and effectively, thanks to the fact Xposed Framework is free and open source app it&#8217;s code is publicly available as repository on contributive development platform GitHub, due to that anyone from internet can not just commit their code to improve Xposed Framework, but also can use it&#8217;s code to develop own forms of Xposed Framework like for instance numerous third party developers over the years already started developing and releasing  various forms of Xposed Framework like  for instance to name few top and popular ones EdXposed and LSPosed etc.</p>
<p>Even though, there are many various forms of Xposed Framework but the one that we are now specifically going to discuss is  LSPosed available as module for Riru and  Zygisk to be installed on Magisk rooted Android devices, which support Android 8.1 and above devices with Magisk v24+, Lsposed has it&#8217;s own framework based on it&#8217;s hooks developers can provide Xposed modules, but a module based on LSPosed framework is fully compatible with original Xposed Framework, and vice versa at the same time Xposed Framework-based module will work well with LSPosed framework, isn&#8217;t that amazing? at the end any form of Xposed Framework you use most of them require root access and they modify apps at runtime without touching apps which is good as it has number of advantages mainly It&#8217;s easy to undo as all the changes are done in memory, you just need to deactivate module and reboot to get your original system back and multiple modules can do changes to the same part of the system or app and many more.</p>
<p>Xposed Framework and it&#8217;s various forms like LSPosed are undoubtedly pretty useful in customizing and get new features on Android devices but thing is as said earlier they all require root due to their design structure and functionality thought it&#8217;s easy to acquire root access but thing is it&#8217;s not always possible to root isn&#8217;t it? you may be for whatever reasons don&#8217;t like and want to root Android devices right? mainly because you must unlock bootloader to root which some OEMs don&#8217;t allow like Asus, IQOO etc including that even if you have such device which has unlockable bootloader still at the end rooting Android devices voilates warranty unless you live in european union, so if you are someone who can&#8217;t root Android but still want to use Xposed Framework then you are at right place, LSPosed is free and open source same as Xposed Framework thanks to that a third party developer JasonKhew96 build and released non- root Xposed framework named LSPatch extending from LSPosed, so that you can do Xposed Framework stuff without root on Android devices, isn&#8217;t that fantastic? so do you like it? are you interested?

					<description><![CDATA[Black / White &#8211; B/W to color photographs &#8211; photos and eventually [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/mcpro24fps-pro-raw-video-camera-app-for-android-smartphones.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/mcpro24fps-pro-raw-video-camera-app-for-android-smartphones.webp" alt="mcpro24fps-pro-raw-video-camera-app-for-android-smartphones" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>Black / White &#8211; B/W to color photographs &#8211; photos and eventually to moving B/W and colour pictures also known as films, the transition of camera and it&#8217;s technologies over past few centuries is revolutionary thanks to continous developments and advancements from inventors around the world which are quite mesmerizing and evolving camera for future due to long time immense efforts of many inventors and companies around the world we from very basic pinhole camera which used to capture B/W and colour photographs on papers and eventually by mid 19th century we got into electronic camera which used to capture photos and films on negetive reels and then by 20th century we got into digital camera which utilize electronic hardware and software technologies to capture and store photos and films in number of different digital formats known as images and videos, they can be viewed using supported softwares on electronic gadgets like PC and smartphones etc.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t know what exactly is camera? then for you in simple camera is basically a gadget that based on integrated technologies can capture and store real life objects in physical form like photos or films and in digital formats like images and videos at first back in early era of camera it used to capture low quality and resolution photos and films but as time goes they were updated and upgraded in order to adapt latest technologies in that process now we got modern cameras packed with powerful and advanced revolutionary technologies by using them you can capture super high quality and resolution images and videos like 2K, 4K, 8K etc including that digital cameras are not limited to one gadget thanks to their potential over the years makers around the world integrated them on many electronic gadgets like desktops, mobiles, CC, smart TVs etc which are flexible and available in small sizes to simply utilize on the go.</p>
<p>In sense, now a days majority of people widely using digital cameras on electronic gadgets they by utilizing many inbuilt hardware and software technologies mainly using hardware sensors like bayer provide unprocessed captured info of camera that will then get processed through software pipeline to capture images and videos in .RAW .dng format which later system software by using codecs can convert them into numerous flexible digital image formats like .jpg, .png and in video container formats like .mp4, .mkv etc so that you will get images and videos in compact size and mode to let almost all devices and softwares view and process them easily at the end device hardware camera sensors and software pipeline technologies play main role in output result quality of images and videos which is why based on requirements you have to get right ones of them so that final output images and videos will work for you or else you may face problems in future.</p>
<p>Usually most makers based on their goals and to adapt inbuilt internal technologies integrate different quality hardware camera sensors and software pipeline technologies on electronic devices the better they are the more amazing images and videos you will get as output result at present in 21st century majority of people worldwide using handheld smartphones over DSLR cameras though on most camera focused and premium flagship smartphones you will get such high quality camera sensors and pipeline software technologies they capture and process high quality and resolution pleasing to eye images and videos but thing is on low and mid end smartphones you will most likely get mediocre hardware camera sensors and software pipeline technologies they provide less appealing low quality images and videos, isn&#8217;t that bit disappointing?</p>
<p>However, sometimes a lot of people mainly film makers and videographers don&#8217;t want software technologies to process camera sensor captured info instead like and want to get unprocessed camera sensor captured RAW images and videos info as orginal as possible so that they get more robust details about them and can simply add custom effects and filters using external softwares effectively to make them way better than system processed one&#8217;s, are you one of them? but thing is if you use smartphones to capture images and videos then as you may know most stock camera software applications use inbuilt camera sensors and stock pipeline software technologies which mostly don&#8217;t provide unprocessed RAW images and videos due to that you have to rely on third party camera softwares to capture them like Google Camera, ON1, Photon Camera and Motioncam etc.</p>
<p>Eventhough, almost all latest smartphones by default can shoot RAW videos but when it comes to Android operating system powered smartphones you must have camera 2 api which was introduced on Android 5.0 lollipop in that you have to enable camera 2 api either full or level 3 to shoot RAW images and videos though by default most makers at present providing them on new Android smartphones but on old ones you won&#8217;t get them but incase if you&#8217;re Android smartphones does have camera 2 api but don&#8217;t support RAW then don&#8217;t worry all you have to do is enable level3 or full using simple adb commands with PC or using root methods based on device but thing is not all smartphones support full and level3 of camera 2 api at the end even if your smartphone have both of them still it may not enable RAW as few makers hide RAW metadata in Android Capabilities and Stream ConfigurationMap you&#8217;ve to tinker with them to unhide and enable RAW, isn&#8217;t that interesting?</p>
<p>Anyhow, even if you have camera 2 api full or level 3 and got RAW support on Android smartphone still you may unable to shoot RAW images and videos as makers don&#8217;t provide RAW support on stock camera even GCam can only shoot RAW images not videos due to that you have to rely on third party camera apps like MotionCam or Photon Camera which are top free and open source image processing camera apps they can shoot unprocessed RAW .dng format images and vidoes efficiently based on specs of smartphone but the drawbacks here is they provide .dng RAW format files which are huge in size like just few seconds of video can be like in giga bytes including that though they are pretty good RAW camera apps but lacking many required things and they&#8217;re not specifically developed for proffesional film making if you&#8217;re into that then it&#8217;s better to choose some way better camera app to shoot RAW images and videos effectively.</p>
<p>Recently, we got to know about one super cool feature rich modern professional video camera app named mcpro24fps which specifically developed to shoot unprocessed RAW videos in HLG / HDR10 HDR, 24 fps, 25 fps, 30 fps, 60 fps as well as in 10 bit on some supported devices with upto 500 mbps bitrate and support for all resolutions specified in Camera2 API but it don&#8217;t use RAW frames and don&#8217;t record in .dng format instead in video container formats like x264 AVC and x265 HEVC yet over the top it is considered as RAW video camera as it shoots gray log flat unprocessed videos and minimizes loss of colors and light curves etc which tries to keep orginal camera sensor info as much as possible so that you will get more details on the videos including that it has seamless integration with LUTs where you can use existing or make custom LUTs as per needs and capabilities of smartphone which are basically colour grading configs to use in post-production of videos and make them as you like including that you will get many amazing tools to shoot best cinematic videos, so do you like it? are you interested? if yes let&#8217;s explore more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/how-to-block-screen-surveillance-of-apps-to-protect-your-privacy.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/how-to-block-screen-surveillance-of-apps-to-protect-your-privacy.webp" alt="how-to-block-screen-surveillance-of-apps-to-protect-your-privacy" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>8.1+ billion human population as per estimates of united nations and many online websites this year are there in this world at the end each and every human is living being and according to the science and research studies considered as more intelligent and quite capable living being than most other living beings who since ages formed civil society advancing from primitive to modern lifestyle with powerful and advanced technologies living in many parts on planet earth building necessary and essential right infrastructure forming various different cities, states, countries with accepted territories ruling them with their own ideology modern governments like democracy, communism, socialism etc along with judiciary out of them large percentage of people thriving and working towards welfare and for better future of people globally, are you one of them?</p>
<p>Each and every human being is unique with his own brain with different IQ aka intelligent quotient and emotional quotient and memories etc what not in almost everything so at the end despite what they are and how they are in any matter they are in general scientifically human beings so there has to be standard rights for equal treatment and welfare of human beings else they can be exploited unfairly or badly in various unethical manners by force or in any other way to get what they want by certain people, government and society for unacceptable self pleasures like to name few untouchability, no food or water on certain human beings based on their race etc which are not good right? to eradicate such things united nations back in time formed human rights commission who developed some fundamental human rights which must be followed by each and every one in this world, amazing right?</p>
<p>Fortunately, most countries around the world accept and follow all fundamental human rights including that since long time from monarchial to current modern governments many of them based on their state and country geographical, social and political nature over time developed many human rights and incorporated them into their country constitution and judiciary for the welfare of citizens and continuously working on to make and transform them to better ones for the future well being and harmonious growth of society at the end a country government has or follow it&#8217;s own human rights or not they must accept and follow fundamental human rights provided by UN human rights commission else it will negetively impact that country in many ways like most countries will blacklist that country and don&#8217;t make any international political and business relations etc to not let that happen most governments atleast publicly state and act that they accept and follow human rights to be in safe zone.</p>
<p>In sense, when a country government, doesn&#8217;t accept and follow fundamental human rights it will eventually get many various different consequences like in form of criticism, revolts and protests not only from their own people but also from other country governments and people which is not fruitful in this rising era of democracy with free press and large scale globalisation that not just decreases economy but also credibility worldwide which is why majority of countries try their best and make their citizens follow each and every basic fundamental human rights but thing is there are some countries who for whatever reasons under the hood don&#8217;t accept and follow human rights instead they somehow manage to look like they do in public view which work many times but sometimes they get exposed and fail to cover up at that time united nations very likely raise questions and concerns, even close connections and put sanctions etc for the welfare of everyone worldwide.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just about governments since ancient times certain individuals, groups, races, religions, creeds, classes, castes, societies etc for whatever reasons don&#8217;t accept, follow, respect, and even violate basic fundamental human rights of other human beings basically people which are accepted and followed by fellow large percentage of people around the world though over the years thanks to evolution of time many unethical and unacceptable types of governments and ideologies due to various different factors changed and transformed into better and modern ones thanks to a lot of people mainly thinkers intellectuals, revolutionaries, politicians, bureaucats etc which are eventually got developed in a way to adapt and work for civilized citizens due to that most people around the world now are in such physical and mental state to be able to accept and follow basic fundamental human rights.</p>
<p>But, thing is even now in modern times there are certain percentage of people for whatever reasons mainly self pleasures etc not only don&#8217;t accept and follow but also violate other people basic human rights though when such things happen to provide justice there are law enforcement agencies setup by governments who can take custody of persons whoever voilated human rights to put charges and punish them strictly as per laws of the judiciary but still there are many people who being aware of laws still knowingly by finding loop holes or in any other ways or means voilate basic human rights of others mainly for personal benefits which can cause problems and unrest among people so at the end to not let anyone voilate your human rights it&#8217;s important that you need to take care in every matter as much as possible in this big world on the go.</p>
<p>Privacy provides personal space and security which since ages almost all people like and want to have wherever possible adapting to era since ancient times a lot of people worked on various matters and introduced such systems to provide and respect privacy of each and everyone and eventually privacy become necessary and important thing to most people so united nations recognised that and added right to privacy as one of must have human rights including that a lot of governments for welfare of their citizens also provided many their own country and state specific privacy laws but thing is for whatever reasons in each and every state and era some people or governments try to somehow voilate privacy of others due to that in many scenario&#8217;s certain people physical and mental state will be at risk so it&#8217;s very important to protect your privacy else consequences will follow for sure.</p>
<p>Especially, the emergence of modern electronic and digital technologies in 20th century it&#8217;s became quite hard to protect privacy as now people and governments etc with the help of electronic and digital technologies like desktops, smartphones and softwares developed using number of programming languages were easily able to spy on people by using device implants or by injecting certain trojans, malware or virus etc in hardware or software system of users so it&#8217;s important to utilize device carefully and install anti-virus softwares as backup to protect your device and privacy quickly and actively else there are skilled hackers from organisations who by using various spywares can exploit your device data and can live track or surveillance on system usage and movements via screen, GPS, phone, messages, sensors, cameras, etc anywhere and anytime due to that now it&#8217;s difficult to protect people&#8217;s privacy.</p>
<p>When it comes to hardware spyware implants they are expensive and used in rare cases on some people while software based sypwares are common and widely used on most devices though since long time many companies and device makers around the world continuously working and advancing technologies to update and upgrade security of systems and provide top class anti-virus and spyware softwares to detect and remove malicious contents and softwares etc but at the end there is always chance that they may be system or legal loop holes which can be exploited to spy on users including that based on the technologies used by spywares they can be undetectable as well which is why at present having privacy is quite precious and many people mainly companies spend huge money to hire experts to manage and secure things and do work effectively.</p>
<p>Eventhough, experts mainly from infrastructure and cyber security fields with their expertize and technologies are even able to detect most undetectable hardware and software updates but thing is normal users usually can&#8217;t or don&#8217;t hire experts instead they fully rely on default security systems provided by makers or anti-sypwares to protect data and privacy which work most of time but not always due to that at some point it may cause personal or financial losses even if you maintain systems carefully in this modern technology world isn&#8217;t that disappointing? but wait it&#8217;s fact that in anyway there is high chance you may hacked by someone that doesn&#8217;t mean you shouldn&#8217;t be careful right? the more care and steps you take to protect your hardware or software system the more they&#8217;re quite less prone to cyber attacks which is why always try to tighten the security of systems in whichever way possible it will eventually safeguard and may workout and turn fruitful for sure.</p>
<p>There are many different types of electronic devices out of them smartphones basically handheld multi-touch technology devices evolution of PDAs are widely used by people though there are many operating systems to run on smartphones but free and open source operating system developed and released by search engine giant Google is most popular one which has more than 70% worldwide market share though Google done a lot of developements and advancements to improve security of Android with regular upgrades and monthly security patches but at the end it&#8217;s not closed source and as past prove that somehow anything in technology can exploited and security can be broken with right technologies so if you own Android don&#8217;t be over confident on it&#8217;s security it can be compromised in various ways even if system is totally encrypted easily.</p>
<p>However, on Android and many other operating systems of electronic devices even if it&#8217;s compromised still you may sometimes won&#8217;t find signs of malicious intruders or spywares etc though over the years Google integrated many security focused technologies inbuild on Android to restrict and even let you manually check and remove them but still sometimes they may fail mainly when you install certain third party apps and customs roms which may contain malwares that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s always recommended to scan them using anti-spyware software before you install them on Android including that though official play store of Google which with modern technologies do scan all apps even notify you about potentially harmful apps but sometimes their system fail as some developers trick them and encrypt sypwares on apps in such ways it&#8217;s hard to auto detect by Google or anyone else.</p>
<p>Especially, there are many ways spyware can be injected into system software or apps and exploit device like for instance malicious spyware apps can on live if given permissions or not can secretly take screenshots or record Android screen and remotely send to it&#8217;s deployer though some times you&#8217;ll find signs like more data usage or battery etc but sometimes they are not at noticeable and detectable levels and if it&#8217;s hardware implant you can&#8217;t do anything with software for that you need expertise on internal hardware to remove it as they are placed strategically in a way that everything feels normal on device but if you really think or wanna stop software based unusual spyware screen sharing then you can simply put to an end to it by blocking screenshot or record permissions of system softwares, amazing right?</p>
<p>We have many ways to stop screen monitoring permissions of sypware system and user apps on Android like by manually disabling all permissions and stop background battery and data usage or you can use VPNs to route unusual traffic or you can even edit apps to remove data trackers and also uninstall them etc whichever you feel are not trustworthy but thing is if you don&#8217;t want to do any of them yet still want to put an end to all screen sharing spywares then don&#8217;t worry you&#8217;re at right place even then you can do that there are some apps which can block screen sharing spywares apps out of them we recently found one useful cool app named Screen Protector by using that you can block screenshots and blacken screen recordings of not just spyware but also all Android screen sharing apps in one go to use system efficiently with privacy, so do you like it? are you interested in Screen Protect? if yes then let&#8217;s explore.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/scene-300x169.webp" alt="scene" width="300" height="169" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-14069" srcset="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/scene-300x169.webp 300w, https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/scene-1024x575.webp 1024w, https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/scene-768x431.webp 768w, https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/scene.webp 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Andy Rubin developed an mobile operating system named Android which didn&#8217;t got much spotlight and most people are not aware of it until Google top search engine giant purchased it for an whooping deal and developed it further to power up smartphones and compete with Apple inc. iOS which is revolutionary modern leading closed source operating system developed exclusively for iPhone series smartphones at first in beginnings Android used to quite struggle to compete and go above iOS but one cool idea of Google to publish Android as foss aka free and open source software using Android open source project inshort AOSP changed everything due to that with in 5 years of time Android sky rocketed in userbase and went ahead of iOS and now Android is cross platform software with more than 70% market share globally.</p>
<p>Android is simply amazing free and open source operating system thanks to AOSP due to that anyone can not only contribute for the advancement of Android but also use source code of AOSP to build their own version of Android to add any further additional optimizations or enhancements etc for better usage on electronic devices due to such facility many makers around the world made various different Android OEM builds for their device users including that a lot of third party developers by using AOSP build amazing custom Android roms mainly to provide more features which are not available on OEM Android devices but thing is in order to install custom roms you have to first unlock device bootloader and install custom recovery like TWRP all this process may void device warranty unless you live in europeon union inshort eu.</p>
<p>Eventhough, many smartphones mainly Qualcomm snapdragon processor based ones have a lot of custom roms as that processor is open source due to that&#8217;s it&#8217;s developer friendly which is why most third party developers like to do most custom development on those processor based Android smartphones as they are more flexible and compatible to support most custom developments if you want them then it&#8217;s better to go with them but thing is device makers use many other processors on Android smartphones like for instance mainly Mediatek and Exynos etc which are closed source ones due to that third party developers struggle and unable to make custom roms and softwares etc for them so in case you&#8217;re running Android on any closed source processor smartphone then it&#8217;s bit hard to do custom developments on them for sure, disappointing isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>However, there are a lot of Qualcomm Snapdragon Android smartphones due to lack of focus from third party developers doesn&#8217;t even have one custom rom and at the end any processor based smartphone since long time majority of device makers mainly for commercial reason stop giving software updates and upgrades after 1 or 2 years due to that Android smartphones eventually become outdated though if your device have latest custom roms you can use them but thing is as said earlier there are many devices which doesn&#8217;t have them if you own such device and it run outdated Android version then it may lead to severe problems as they very likely have number  of loopholes which compromise system&#8217;s security and privacy but don&#8217;t worry there is Project Treble with that we can get GSIs by using them you can update devices to latest Android versions easily and keep them up-to-date to stay in safe zone.</p>
<p>Google back in year 2017 introduced Project Treble on Android 8.0 oreo to fix OEM&#8217;s late and no updates and upgrades that provide GSI aka generic system image which is basically pure implementation of Android without code changes so almost all Android smartphones with processors like Qualcomm snapdragon and Mediatek though it&#8217;s closed source one still without much difficulty it can install them though full hardware and software support and compatibility is no guaranteed isn&#8217;t that amazing? but thing is if you own Android device with old versions like 7.0 nougut or 6.0 marshmallow then it&#8217;ll not come with Treble support so you can&#8217;t install GSI&#8217;s on them unless developers upgrade device to 8.0 Oreo though there are many unofficial methods to get Project Treble support on unsupported smartphones at the end it&#8217;s always better to use official Treble support smartphone to run most GSIs efficiently.</p>
<p>In sense, if your device maker or third party developer from trusted platforms like XDA or anywhere else upgraded device software to Android 8.0 oreo then you will  automatically get Project Treble support but thing is there are certain processors like for instance Spreadtrum which is now known as Unisoc powered smartphones are not fully compatible with custom roms and GSIs even if you try to install most of them won&#8217;t boot for sure not just unisoc processor even there are many Qualcomm Snapdragon and Mediatek treble support devices also don&#8217;t have custom roms and won&#8217;t boot most GSIs as chances of GSI booting is 50/50 rate which is why many users who have unisoc or any processor smartphone which can&#8217;t boot GSIs try to find other ways to keep Android uptodate if you are one of them then all you just have to do is simply root Android well.</p>
<p>Rooting is basically software that unlocks write access to system level partition on Android devices back in early versions of Android at the time it&#8217;s very easy to root Android you just need apps like Kingoroot to root smartphones instantly on the go but eventually as time goes Google done many advancements and quite tightened security of Android due to that on latest smartphones first have to unlock device bootloader that wipes userdata so always backup to not lose data after that install rooting software back in time we used to have ChainFire SuperSu to root Android smartphones but it was discontinued in 2016 at that time developer TopJohnWu developed and released systemless super cool root software named Magisk which is now widely used by Android users globally once you done rooting you can customize and manage Android device extensively.</p>
<p>But, in order to customize or manage Android you usually have to be an skilled developer with proper understanding on structure of Android else you may do something incorrect which may result in hard or soft bricked Android smartphone which is sometimes irreparable so always be careful at the end to let normal users get most of Android a lot of third party developers build CLI and GUI to customize and manage Android extensively though out of them many are pretty good but lack numerous important and necessary tools  due to that you can&#8217;t do tasks effectively if you are ok with such mediocre softwares it&#8217;s fine but if you&#8217;re not and looking out for better ones then you are at right place we recently got to know about fantastic all in one professional geeky app named Scene for all rooted Android 10 smartphones by using that you can manage and customize your Android extremely and effectively on go, so do you like it? are you interested in Scene? if yes then let&#8217;s explore more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/silencio-a-web3-network-to-explore-noise-maps-and-earn-rewards.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/silencio-a-web3-network-to-explore-noise-maps-and-earn-rewards.webp" width="400" alt="silencio-a-web3-network-to-explore-noise-maps-and-earn-rewards"></a></p>
<p>Noise, do you know what exactly is this? It&#8217;s basically word used when certain sound is at such decibels which is inconvenient and causing disturbance in anyway to fellow listeners in surroundings or anywhere else but in order to understand noise better first you must know what exactly is sound? </p>
<p>Even thought most people already know about sound but if you are not then for you in simple sound is invisible thing that will be generated when physical materials at certain force contract eachother that travels through air in waves format but thing is with normal human eyes you can&#8217;t see them, isn&#8217;t that bit disappointing? </p>
<p>However, sound strength can be scentifically measured in db aka decibals using tools including that we have number of revolutionary technologies on electronic devices developed by inventors over the years worldwide by using them you can not only record but also play most sounds electronically and digitally on the go.</p>
<p>In sense, sound and air is interconnected and the higher decibal sound you can generate using whatever things the more distance it will travel in 360° angle at the end you can not just make pleasent sounds but also unpleasent ones which are very likely considered as noises.</p>
<p>However, sound preferences are definitely user specific as each individual may have different taste of sounds like for some people even the sounds which are fully considered as unpleasant by majority of  people still feel pleasent and they like to enjoy them on the go, isn&#8217;t that right? </p>
<p>But anyhow at the end some low and mainly high frequency decibal sounds can damage ears of listeners as each living being has certain limited sound tolerance capacity so always when making sounds either physically or electronically and then listening to them always be careful.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t then it may be not just irritating or disturbing but also damage ear canals instantly or over the time and may also cause health problems which is why a lot of people globally like and want to stay or live and travel in a quite place where is no or less noises as much as possible.</p>
<p>In queit places people most people likely able to more focus, relax, enjoy moments joyfully thought most state governments framed laws to control unpleasant noises mainly high ones whichever considered as noise pollution but thing is noises are bit hard and difficult to control anywhere.</p>
<p>Noises are thought unpleasant sounds but at the end they are basically sounds which are connected to almost everything in this universe so stopping or blocking them is not easy task though each living being may have it&#8217;s own temperament of sound like some handle unpleasant sounds well while others may can&#8217;t even bare them.</p>
<p>In case, you can&#8217;t bare noises or even if  you can handle them well still you have to plan things accordingly and then go to area whichever suits your interests well though based on area characteristics you may estimate noise levels but unless you visit or ask someone you won&#8217;t know exact present noise levels of area for sure.</p>
<p>Nowadays, we people to find routes of areas using apps like Google and Apple Maps etc which use satellite technologies but they will only show directions not noise levels what if there is an app that let let you measure noise levels of your area and also show area maps worldwide with noise levels, it will be fantastic right?</p>
<p>Web3 is future upgrade of internet which is basically concept of decentralization of  internet in which we use decentralized servers to power up internet thought Web3 already implemented on crypto currencies like Bitcoin but in recent times developers building almost all Web3 softwares.</p>
<p>Recently, we got to know about one interesting Web3 community powered network named Silencio that as said earlier let you measure noise of your surroundings and submit noise levels on sound area maps which is turning volume down noise pollution around the world.</p>
<p>The main benefits of silencio is you are not only contributing to global sound maps but for just submitting noise levels and exploring soundscapes of the world with interactive noise exposure sound map you&#8217;ll get noise coins which you can soon exchange for rewards in marketplace.</p>
<p>Silencio let you access global sound censes and foster a quieter world on that you can contribute to rich global sound database or refer to earn noise coins at present be one of our early adopters of Silencio and claim share of Silencio&#8217;s Beta Airdrop so hurry up before it&#8217;s over.</p>
<p>Note : this app silencio designed for general sound measurement purposes and should not be used as a replacement for professional devices as silencio only measures approximate decibel levels, so do you like it? are you still interested in Silencio, if yes then let&#8217;s explore more.</p>

<p>Bingo, now explore Silencio.</p>
<p>Atlast, this are just highlighted features of Silencio there may be many hidden features in-build that provides you external benefits to give the ultimate usage experience, anyway if you want one of the best app to measure sounds and explore sound maps around the world then at present Silencio is on go choice.</p>
<p>Overall, Silencio comes with light mode by default, it has clean and simple interface that ensures user friendly experience, but in any project there is always space for improvement so let&#8217;s wait and see will Silencio get any major UI changes in future to make it even more better, as of now Silencio is pretty interesting one.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is definitely worth to mention Silencio is one of the very few noise measuring Web3 apps available out there on world wide web of internet that let you submit noise and explore sound maps of areas worldwide, yes indeed if you are searching for such app then Silencio has potential to become your new favorite.</p>
<p>Finally, this is Silencio by using that you not just help it to shape a quieter world, one decibel at a time but also mine noise coins and exchange them for rewards like vouchers, premium memberships etc, are you an existing user of  Silencio? If yes kindly mention if you know any way app that&#8217;s way better than Silencio in our comment section below, see ya 🙂</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/how-to-move-apps-from-internal-storage-to-sd-card-on-android-devices.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/how-to-move-apps-from-internal-storage-to-sd-card-on-android-devices.webp" width="400" alt="how-to-move-apps-from-internal-storage-to-sd-card-on-android-devices"></a></p>
<p>Storage is basically term denoted for certain free space in area or container in which you can store whatever things you want as long as free space available like not totally occupied and full which is of 2  types physical and electronic storage both are widely used worldwide when it comes to physical we store material objects and then in electronic one we store digital files like audio, video, documents etc in various different structures and formats like .mp4, .hevc, .mkv, .pdf, .jpg  etc at the end each and every material and digital thing based on it&#8217;s capacity and technology usually has it&#8217;s own shape and size so always better to get big storage space as high as possible according to needs so that you will be able to store more things efficiently on go.</p>
<p>Eventhough, there is physical storage for material things but it goes out of topic so as per context we&#8217;re going to specifically focus on electronic storage which is basically non volatile electronic memory that we use on most electronic devices like PCs, smartphones, music players etc which can store data permanently thought over the years inventors created number of different types of electronic memory but the modern one which we are widely using around the world is electronically erasable read only memory inshort EEPROM that technology at present is integrated mainy on HDDs aka hard disk drives and SSDs aka sold state drives they  both are amazing but difference here is HDDs are less price and store recorded data using platters while SSDs are quite expensive and use flash memory which is way more modern and faster than HDDs so as per requirements use right one.</p>
<p>Nowadays, most makers integrating HDDs on electronic devices and a lot of people like and prefer to use them over SSDs because HDDs are less expensive and does job pretty well though in parrallel SSDs are also in wide usage and it also has potential to fully replace HDDs in future but at present considering userbase SSDs are not upto level of HDDs at the end HDD or SDD are available in different sizes and capacities from kbs aka kilobytes to zbs aka zetabytes which when integrated and comes inbuild on electronic devices like PCs or smartphones it is considered as internal storage of device where you can store OS and whatever digital files you want easily thought if you got big internal storage most likely you don&#8217;t have to worry but if you have small HDD or SSD or you are someone who wanna store files which exceed capacity of internal storage in that case you may have to depend and connect external storages to electronic devices.</p>
<p>You may probably already aware of external storages like portable HDDs and SSDs, pendrives, SD cards they can be connected to electronic devices to use as additional storage space when internal one is not enough or for whatever reason you want secondary storage thought you can store almost all digital files on external storage but moving and running certain system files and resources is not possible unless system allows device thought on most PC operating systems by simply enabling superadminstator you can move and run system resources on external storages but when it comes to smartphone operating systems like Android it&#8217;s bit hard as you have to first unlock bootloader and install rooting softwares like SuperSu or Magisk to get write access to system partition after that only you&#8217;ll be able to move and run system resources on external storages but thing is all this process voids device warranty.</p>
<p>Android is well known popular mobile operating system which is basically free and open source software released by Google that currently has more than 70% worldwide and over the years rapidly gone through many developements to make it modern one suitable and flexible for most users at first in early versions of Android thought not all system resources but if device support SD card we used to get option to move system apps to SD card but for whatever reason Google removed move app to SD card option in the latest versions of Android and introduced format as SD card option that let you use your external SD card as internal storage which is pretty useful for those who have less internal storage and wanna increase it but thing is for a lot of people it&#8217;s not always possible to use SD card as internal storage right? If possible better try to keep them seperate so that you&#8217;ll have internal as well as external storage to use effectively.</p>
<p>But, the problem here is it&#8217;s not always possible to store certain system resources on internal storage isn&#8217;t it? mainly because they occupy so much space for instance when it comes to software applications of Android OS which are known as apps available in format .apk when they get installed on device if .apk size and it&#8217;s resources are big then they occupy a lot of space on internal storage including that when you keep on using and storing data on app it stores user cache that further decrease space of internal storage which is something a lot of people don&#8217;t want to happen and wish to store Android apps on secondary storage SD card so that they can have more space on primary internal storage but as said earlier on new Android versions Google removed move app to SD card option so now to move apps to SD card for that we have to use root apps they&#8217;ll do all process quite efficiently.</p>
<p>We have many amazing root apps which have functionality to move apps to sd card but the problem here is many root apps are paid and most of them ask you to make secondary partition or format SD card to move apps which wipe existing user data including that many move apps to sd card apps are limited in features and out of them most are outdated and only available for old Android versions that&#8217;s because back in early era of Android OS we used to have small storage capacity smartphones so at that time it&#8217;s important for a lot of people to must have move app to SD card app as without them device is bit difficult to use as there is demand most developers used to keep them up to date but now we are getting big storage capacity smartphones so for most people internal storage is enough to keep almost everything but still there are some people  who want reliable root app to move apps to SD card safely, are you one of them?</p>
<p>The reason why some people want to move apps to SD card is mainly because many low and mid end smartphones come with less storage space thought on high end ones we get big storage space but for some users it&#8217;s not enough at the end  mostly such users want reliable app to move apps to SD card though there are many good root apps on Google Play to do that job but wait don&#8217;t rush there is one reliable feature rich app named Scene5 which is not available on Google Play but can do alot of system customization on Android including move apps to SD card though it&#8217;s actually made for Mediatek processor smartphones but it also work on Qualcomm Snapdragon ones with support for latest Android versions but note kindly don&#8217;t mess with certain things on Scene5 without knowledge as it can either hard or softbrick Android device which is likely fixable but sometimes irreparable, so do you like it? are you still interested? If yes let&#8217;s explore more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pocket-a-feature-rich-crm-to-manage-small-businesses.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pocket-a-feature-rich-crm-to-manage-small-businesses.webp" alt="pocket-a-feature-rich-crm-to-manage-small-businesses" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>Business is something that a lot of people don&#8217;t want to do as it involves profits and loss at the end of your set time period or you can say goal it can be day or month and year if you drive it into profits then it&#8217;s hurray for everyone but if it goes to loss then it will become bit difficult to manage and run business well which is why some percentage of people like and prefer jobs in successful company over business as in job in most scenarios you&#8217;ll be paid salary on hourly, daily or monthly basis isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>You may say companies run business if they get loss then it will effect the job holder right? you&#8217;re correct but it will not impact as much as it will be on business mainly when it comes to companies business if they are in loss then the job holder known as employee will be mostly asked to work for more time or reduce little or more salary even remove from company with notice prior week or month so that employee can find another job to earn for living expenditures on the go.</p>
<p>In sense, as there is no personal investment of employees in company they are not much effected financially but when it comes to companies in order to start it businessmans aka entrepreneurs invest using their personal savings and assets mainly they take loans from number of agencies and banks etc due to that they highly have to run business in profits else it will negetively impact them as well as investors and banks if it goes in loss for long time then eventually company have to close it&#8217;s business operations completely.</p>
<p>Since ancient times most entrepreneurs know the value of customer in business as without sufficient number of customers it&#8217;s quite difficult to run the business in profits for long time which is why almost all expert businessmans show and give at most respect and care to customers with best price valueable and quality products and services so that they can build trust and relationship with customers which will eventually turn up fruitful to business as it can make 1 or two time visitors as regular customers which is quite beneficial.</p>
<p>When large percentage of first time visitors become regular customers to business it will build positive and good brand value including that many existing regular or irregular customers who like your business products or services may spread your brand name through various channels mainly word of mouth or social networks etc which will increase visitors and customers to your business that will let you develop sustainable business in one or more locations around the world to grow business further and reach the financial goals with profits in less time.</p>
<p>In olden days there is time when businessmans have no option other then to directly in person build relationship and manage customers which is bit difficult yet as there is no better choice businesses used to go in that way but after long time we got wired and wireless communication technologies like telegraphs, telephones etc which helped and simplified business relations and management with fellow customers immensely thought they are awesome and widely used even today but at present most businesses specifically using revolutionary digital technology.</p>
<p>Digital technologies are basically softwares developed using number of programming languages which can be used on electronic devices like PCs and smartphones etc at present we have many revolutionary digital technologies created by developers for various purposes out of them a lot are used by businesses but the primary and most used one is customer relationship management inshort CRM softwares which are usually packed with many useful tools specifically created to manage small and big businesses.</p>
<p>CRM softwares are super helpful to build relationship and manage customers effectively and efficiently but thing is most professional CRM softwares are not free and mostly available for PCs which is bit disappointing isn&#8217;t it? as most people nowadays using smartphones to manage business right? if you are looking for mobile CRM then you&#8217;re at right place we recently got to know about an amazing feature rich CRM named Pocket which will let you manage your customers pretty well conveniently, so do you like it? are you interested?

<p>Keyboard, a revolutionary invention that not only changed the way we do things but it also become important thing in our life as you may know keyboard is basically a hardware device with alphabets from a to z and numbers from 1 to 9 including that there are many more things which all are known as commands required to connect and communicate with computer or other electronic devices by using them you can make connected devices perform various different tasks electronically and digitally based on it&#8217;s integral technologies.</p>
<p>In sense, keyboard is bridge between you and electronic devices though you can also use mouse pointer but it&#8217;s very much limited to GUI aka graphical user interface operating system based devices when it comes to keyboard it can be used on CLI aka command line operating system as well as on GUI ones which is why experts recommend beginners to control and get used to keyboards over mouse pointer to do all things so that they&#8217;ll be flexible and able to do tasks quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>There are several keyboard types created by number of inventors around the world after doing a lot of R&amp;D aka research and development on arrangements of key words to make them user-friendly and convenient for users though there are numerous keyboards but the one that most people immensely using from past few decades is ergonomic design qwerty keyboard which is why majority of people to go as per trend like and prefer to learn that over others, are you one of them?</p>
<p>The main goal of inventors in making of keyboards is to make your interactions and typing on whatever electronic devices quicker though qwerty keyboard is well known and popular one but not everyone is comfortable with it due to various reasons for Instance some people don&#8217;t use qwerty instead they choose such keyword which ever is convenient for typing according to their size of fingers and personal preference on arrangements of keywords, numbers commands etc.</p>
<p>Eventhough, there are some proffesional typists and people who use and say even argue and recommend stating and highly suggesting that Dvorak keyboard is way better and comfortable than qwerty which as per them increases speed as well as accuracy thier words have value as the world&#8217;s fastest typer Barbara Blackburn even use and made world record using Dvorak keyboard but thing is majority of people globally use qwerty due to that most developers and companies created qwerty keyboard learning softwares.</p>
<p>Nowadays, most keyboard learning softwares available for computers are qwerty based ones out of them some include Dvorak as well which is quite acceptable and understandable but thing is as said earlier there are several types of keyboards though they have quite small userbase including that even qwerty itself have different versions which are widely used in different countries yet mostly not provided by many cool keyboard learning softwares like to few JIS in Japan, Azerty in French etc, isn&#8217;t that dissapointing?</p>
<p>Typing Master is well known and popular feature rich software to learn typing yet still not everyone like to use it though it has several games but at the end it&#8217;s only available for PCs and it&#8217;s not much attractive and gripping one which is why a lot of people learn and test their typing skills using online websites or find and use alternative softwares which are way better and works best for them to pratice qwerty or Dvorak typing on the go.</p>
<p>Recently, we got to know about an no ads super fun and entertaining offline cross platform feature rich typing learning software named Typing Land filled with around 81 lessons as of now available for smartphones which offers Dvorak and different types of qwerty keyboard including that you can directly use on pc or simply load app on emulators even just connect keyboard with smartphone via hdmi, so do you like it? are you interested in Typing Land?
