										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/hege-natural-mineral-water-from-the-foothills-of-himalayas-review.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/hege-natural-mineral-water-from-the-foothills-of-himalayas-review.webp" width="400" alt="hege-natural-mineral-water-from-the-foothills-of-himalayas-review"></a></p>
<p>ॐ Hara hara mahadev, water is colourless, transparent, inorganic and odorless liquid substance with chemical formula H2O filled up with number of minerals like calcium, potassium, magnesium, sodium, bicarbonate, chloride etc known as ions and electrolytes which are quite essential not just for humans but also other living organisms in order to live and survive on this planet earth but the water you drink must be proper and have purity then only you&#8217;ll be able to live healthy, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>Whenever a living organism in this nature of world get thirsty due to lack of enough liquid and electrolytes basically minerals which were lost due to whatever reasons mainly due to urination, sun heat, physical activities etc so to get them most of them drink water to get back minerals to body which will pass through blood cells via veins to make your body functionalities properly which is why it&#8217;s important to always drink pure water not polluted ones which can cause severe health problems and may put you in hospital as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/1_hege-natural-mineral-water-from-the-foothills-of-himalayas-review.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/1_hege-natural-mineral-water-from-the-foothills-of-himalayas-review.webp" width="400" alt="1_hege-natural-mineral-water-from-the-foothills-of-himalayas-review"></a></p>
<p>There are number of ways to get water on earth as the planet itself has more than 96.5 ocean water which is super salty and if directly consumed is harmful and not drinkable by humans unless done proper reverse osmosis which are usually not consumed by people instead since ancient times most people mainly depended on water from rivers sourced from mountains, rains and groundwater etc which are now also primary sources to get usable and drinkable water for humans globally.</p>
<p>Humans known as people in modern society over the years by creating and adapting to latest technologies developed numerous powerful and advanced water management systems with high quality infrastructure in developed countries where water sourced from rivers or anywhere else is processed carefully with right equipments like reverse osmosis RV filters to reduce hardness of water and remove harmful and toxic contaminants like lead, aluminum, fluoride etc in order to get or provide best possible clean and safe water to people in country.</p>
<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2_hege-natural-mineral-water-from-the-foothills-of-himalayas-review.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2_hege-natural-mineral-water-from-the-foothills-of-himalayas-review.webp" width="400" alt="2_hege-natural-mineral-water-from-the-foothills-of-himalayas-review"></a></p>
<p>Eventhough, now large percentage of people around the world mainly from developed countries able to get and drink safe water but still in few developing and many undeveloped countries due to lack of proper infrastructure and lack of facilities and water management systems not even able to store and purify water well instead they depends on old methods which work in most cases but in some cases they won&#8217;t which is why you&#8217;ll find In some countries many people get diseases like cholera by drinking impure water from rivers and ground bore water etc.</p>
<p>But, in developed countries also due to negligence in maintenance of drinking water by people and mainly government and private authorities, people prone to unsafe contaminant polluted water which even contain plastic, pesticides, estrogen etc got from industrial wastes which are  released to rivers by factories illegally that&#8217;s risky and cause health hazards which is why a lot of people around the world to get clean and pure drinkable water using various different reverse osmosis machines extensively.</p>
<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/3_hege-natural-mineral-water-from-the-foothills-of-himalayas-review.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/3_hege-natural-mineral-water-from-the-foothills-of-himalayas-review.webp" width="400" alt="3_hege-natural-mineral-water-from-the-foothills-of-himalayas-review"></a></p>
<p>RV and RO aka reverse osmosis been available in market long time which can not just remove bacteria and harmful contaminants but also minerals that makes water soft as hardness of water depends on deposited minerals solids which reduces alkalinity based on your settings upto 98% that&#8217;s quite harmful to health as regular and proper well balanced level pure mineral water must for humans as body contains upto 60% water so they are required for body to work properly.</p>
<p>In sense, the level of minerals in water determines the alkaline and ph value which has to be under WHO aka world health organization standards at the same time based on health and medical conditions of person offcourse else it can lead to severe negative effects like for instance insufficient minerals leads to reduced cognitive function of brain and  dehydration that eventually lead to low or high blood pressure that can cause body parts functions and heart failure as well which is why it&#8217;s essential for anyone somehow through water or electrolyte filled fruit juices get minerals required every day sufficiently for safety.</p>
<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/4_hege-natural-mineral-water-from-the-foothills-of-himalayas-review.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/4_hege-natural-mineral-water-from-the-foothills-of-himalayas-review.webp" width="400" alt="4_hege-natural-mineral-water-from-the-foothills-of-himalayas-review"></a></p>
<p>There are numerous ways to get liquid based minerals for body but at the end organic way using water is best way to restore fluids and minerals into body over unhealthy caffeine drinks even if they are filled with minerals as caffeine can pump up blood without minerals that can cause dehydration thought it has benefits like improved mood or concentration etc but the thing is direct water came from rivers and ground bore water contains harmful contaminants and sometimes water is super hard so in that scenarios using RV and RO methods and device technologies is smart and useful but there are organic better alternatives to it for sure.</p>
<p>Now a days, in most homes and offices etc you&#8217;ll find people use electronic device RV and RO technologies which f you use correctly then they are super useful and work productively but if you don&#8217;t know how to exactly use them and requirements for daily required minerals then you can be in health troubles which is why we got much better organic and safer way to get pure water like by using charcoal activated filter and water bottles which will attract and remove contaminants and toxics etc to provide clean water, isn&#8217;t that cool?</p>
<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/5_hege-natural-mineral-water-from-the-foothills-of-himalayas-review.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/5_hege-natural-mineral-water-from-the-foothills-of-himalayas-review.webp" width="400" alt="5_hege-natural-mineral-water-from-the-foothills-of-himalayas-review"></a></p>
<p>However, majority of people are not aware and don&#8217;t use normal or activated charcoal water purification methods instead use RV and RO technologies but as said earlier it removes minerals to big extent, if you&#8217;re someone who want pure water with minerals at safe WHO standard levels but don&#8217;t want RO and RV processed water from local metropolitan water supply quality or anywhere else then you have to get natural water directly from start of natural rivers surrounded by mountains or springs where you&#8217;ll get best quality pure drinkable natural mineral water which are good and improve health effectively.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not possible for most people in this world to get natural mineral spring water from the beggining of rivers surrounded by mountains or anything else as 90% percentage of people don&#8217;t leave near to them like in in metropolitan urban or suburban localities even in rural areas as well even if you live still you may need skills or certain equipments to get best quality water which not everyone can do that process isn&#8217;t it? but many people like and prefer to drink them everyday.</p>
<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/6_hege-natural-mineral-water-from-the-foothills-of-himalayas-review.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/6_hege-natural-mineral-water-from-the-foothills-of-himalayas-review.webp" width="400" alt="6_hege-natural-mineral-water-from-the-foothills-of-himalayas-review"></a></p>
<p>Usually, mountains and rivers are not available in all countries which is why they are rare and they are hard to climb as well so it&#8217;s quite adventurous to reach them facing different environment and nature condition to drink natural spring water but now in this modern world of powerful.and advanced technologies of capitalist world as there is huge demand for spring natural mineral water many companies using their resources started packing spring natural mineral water in bottles and then selling in offline and online stores worldwide.</p>
<p>Thankfully, in bharat that is now known as india in english, we have number of sacred rivers and mountains like Himalayas which are well known and one of the tallest and popular mountains where God Shiva reside which are quite beautiful and astonishing including the Himalayas are drained by 19 major sacred rivers like Ganga, Yamuna, Bhramaputra etc isn&#8217;t that amazing as it&#8217;s fully terrain area and rivers flow through mountains hills you will get best clean and pure quality natural spring mineral water so many indian companies mainly from past few years to started packing and selling them well commercially.</p>
<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/7_hege-natural-mineral-water-from-the-foothills-of-himalayas-review.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/7_hege-natural-mineral-water-from-the-foothills-of-himalayas-review.webp" width="400" alt="7_hege-natural-mineral-water-from-the-foothills-of-himalayas-review"></a></p>
<p>We have numerous brands in india who sell himalayas natural spring water out of them Hege brand seems super value for money then other companies as their way of explanation and process of getting natural mineral water from Himalayas are not just interesting but also spectacular which will amaze you but before getting into more details about Hege let&#8217;s first know why the prices of natural mineral spring water is high then regular water which you get at low prices easily.</p>
<p>Generally, natural spring water is untouched by humans and processed directly from natural rivers surrounded by mountains or anything else including that they are not processed through reverse osmosis so you&#8217;ll get high amount of quality and pure minerals and alkaline level which is good for health including that as companies process them near to mountains from areas it is hard to not just make but also transport which is hard and take more time than regular water that&#8217;s why natural spring mineral water is 50% even more costly then regular water but if you can afford then they are worthy.</p>
<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/8_hege-natural-mineral-water-from-the-foothills-of-himalayas-review.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/8_hege-natural-mineral-water-from-the-foothills-of-himalayas-review.webp" width="400" alt="8_hege-natural-mineral-water-from-the-foothills-of-himalayas-review"></a></p>
<p>When it comes to Hege, foremost as soon as we got to know about Hege himalayas spring water we contacted their customer support and raised our concerns regarding quality and management of Himalayan water by Hege, we really impressed by the customer support who politely and patiently addressed and answered our raised questions to clarify on everything about how they handle Himalayas natural spring water to customers including that they even delivered as sample product so that we can taste and review it, but kindly note we are not paid by Hege, whatever we are now going to say about Hege is based on our personal experience with Hege.</p>
<p>Hege is Untouched and Unprocessed natural mineral water is directly sourced from under earth pools called aquifers near Himalayas springs and mountains which gone through 20 years of journey as acquifers are covered by thick layer of clay that protects water from contamination due to that you&#8217;ll get crisp and pure natural mineral water which are then filled in one time use recyclable PET aka Polyethylene Terephthalate plastic jars and then deliver to you in 24 hours after payment currently only in some cities like Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad in india.</p>
<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/9_hege-natural-mineral-water-from-the-foothills-of-himalayas-review.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/9_hege-natural-mineral-water-from-the-foothills-of-himalayas-review.webp" width="400" alt="9_hege-natural-mineral-water-from-the-foothills-of-himalayas-review"></a></p>
<p>The main benefits of Hege natural mineral water as it&#8217;s directly sourced from the 7000m altitude foothills of Himalayas it is pristine and loaded with many essential minerals like calcium &#8211; 62, magnesium &#8211; 15, bicarbonate &#8211; 263, sodium &#8211; 27, sulfate &#8211; 5.2, chloride &#8211; 06, potassium &#8211; 2.0, nitrates -1.6 and PH ranges from 7.4 &#8211; 7.7 that means TDS aka total dissolved solids are &gt;250 and approx 8.0 alkanity per 20 ltr Bootle which is satisfactory as most other companies offer similar quantity.</p>
<p>You may wonder, what makes Hege different and special from them is they provide you coordinates &#8211; 32.2432° N, 77.1892° E,  where they are directly sourcing natural mineral water from Himalayas and lab certification test pdf of it&#8217;s natural mineral water if required directly from website or call to gain your trust and provide assurance about quality of product sincerly and geniunely.</p>
<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/10_hege-natural-mineral-water-from-the-foothills-of-himalayas-review.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/10_hege-natural-mineral-water-from-the-foothills-of-himalayas-review.webp" width="400" alt="10_hege-natural-mineral-water-from-the-foothills-of-himalayas-review"></a></p>
<p>In our opinion, natural mineral water of Hege as it&#8217;s from Himalayas is good and we even seen white mineral deposits which confirm that it&#8217;s natural mineral water as you normally won&#8217;t get them in regular water but the price though less then other brands at INR 900 which you can get for INR 450 for first time users using TRYME50 coupon code with flexible subscription options and cash on delivery but still it&#8217;s bit expensive considering in indian market as most people in india don&#8217;t buy natural spring water, if they want to get more customers then we believe that it&#8217;s better if they decrease price bit further other then that rest is awesome.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[If you live in india, you probably know Airtel is one of [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/airtel-thanks-bitcoin-worth-100-e282b9-for-free-coinswitch-kuber.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/airtel-thanks-bitcoin-worth-100-e282b9-for-free-coinswitch-kuber.webp" width="400" alt="airtel-thanks-bitcoin-worth-100-e282b9-for-free-coinswitch-kuber"></a></p>
<p>If you live in india, you probably know Airtel is one of the popular and costliest network in india but when reliance&#8217;s jio entered into telecom market it wiped all the existing networks with thier extreme low priced internet data packs with additional benefits that effected telecom networks like Airtel, vodafone and idea etc which used to provide network data packs at very high prices with low validity due to that most users started switching from all of this networks to Jio for internet usages which made jio #1 network in india.</p>
<p>But, when jio is not in market Airtel used to be #1 top network due to that reason airtel didn&#8217;t lost all of it&#8217;s customers some of the customers still stayed with them so to gain customers again they have only one option which is to start providing thier data packs similar to jio &#038; they did it even though it taken some time.</p>
<p>However, Airtel is a big company they have presense in numerous different platforms like Airtel Bank, Dish network, audio and video online streaming services etc so to attract &#038; gain new customers they frequently give offers on thier platforms while most offers airtel provide can only be utilised on thier airtel products but right now Airtel bill payment app named Airtel Thanks giving numerous value for money coupons while all of them are good but CoinSwitch Kuber crypto trading platform 100 rupees worth of bitcoin free coupon is interesting.</p>
<p>If you are familiar with crypto currencies you probably know about bitcoin it is the world&#8217;s first decentralised virtual currency created by satoshi nakamoto in 2009 from then bitcoin price spiked up it&#8217;s value like today it is one of the costliest and popular crypto coin in the world that means if you brought bitcoin in 2009 and hold in your wallet then you are billionaire now.</p>
<p>It is better late then never! You can still buy and sell bitcoin through trading using any crypto exchanges platforms we have many crypto exchanges in all countries but you have to choose one that suits for you like most traders choose a crypto exchange platform that charge low fees for buy, sell, trade and withdraw crypto coins to get good profits of thier crypto property.</p>
<p>Due to big competition between crypto trading platforms many crypto trading platforms conduct giveaways &#038; provide free crypto currencies on new sign ups which will get them long terms usage of thier app from new members which is a mutual benefit for provider and user</p>
<p>We recently found out many crypto trading apps that provides free crypto currencies on new sign ups but choosing the best one is necessary else you may get issues later because once you choose any trading app that must give you solid experience to use thier platform for long terms instead trying and switching to different trading apps will make you to do frequent withdrawals that can give negative effect on crypto profits.</p>
<p>In this scenario we excited to announce a crypto trading app that has low takers fee and give you ultimate solid experience to all traders with thier advanced features named CoinSwitch Kuber, On this app you can reddem airtel thanks app 100 ruppees bitcoin coupon but for only new sign ups and first time only valid in time of 24 hours for free else the free 100 ruppees bitcoin coupon will be lost.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/hiox-india-get-in-domain-at-99rs-for-1-year.webp" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techtracker5.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/hiox-india-get-in-domain-at-99rs-for-1-year.webp" width="400" height="224" alt="HIOX India - Get .in domain at 99rs for 1 year!"></a></p>
<p>Do you ever wanted to buy domain in low price? If yes there are alot of websites do provide top level popular domains like .in, .com or .xyz etc, every week or month due to competition between domain &#038; hosting websites they provide various top domains at low price giving promo codes to tackle competitors &#038; increase thier brand identity and popularity among internet users. </p>
<p><strong>Yes</strong>, domain &#038; hosting providers give a lot of offers to public so that they can create a lot of hype about thier website and gain customers so that they can combinely get future investments from customer, for <strong>ex</strong>. most domain &#038; hosting providers only give 1st year domain at low price in most cases or domain &#038; hosting providers give hosting only pay while 1st year of domain free. </p>
<p><strong>However</strong>, this domain &#038; hosting providers in most scenarios only try to give 1st year at low cost and from 2nd year they will do charge you more amount or regular price for domain and hosting, in this way they were able to get profits and retain users for long time making them to purchase from thier service itself instead others. </p>
<p><strong>Eventhough</strong>, there are alot of things that were involved in this subject, still getting huge discount for purchasing domains is definitely profitable for new customer but it is important to check renewal prices as certain domain providers like wordpress give domain at low price for 1st year then in renewal they double the price which is not acceptable if you concerned about it, so check the renewal prices of domains were normal or not later proceed to buy which will not get any issues in future. </p>
<p>We do like to buy domain at lower prices and we are in continuous search finding domain providers which will provide the top-level domains in lower price and we found an domain provider named <strong>HiOX</strong></p>
<p><strong>India</strong> started in <strong>2004</strong> which is currently providing huge value for money offers like .in domain at 99rs which is definitely worth because most domain providers currently priced them at 399rs to 699rs atleast. </p>
